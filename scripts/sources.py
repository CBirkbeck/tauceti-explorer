"""Where the roadmaps' mathematics comes from, and whether a reader can get it.

A roadmap stage is only checkable by someone who can read its source. Cite a book
behind a paywall and the stage is unreadable to most readers, and to every worker,
so the work stalls on an acquisition nobody can make. This keeps a register of the
works the roadmaps cite, `research/blueprint/sources/ACCESS.json`, records for each
whether it is freely available, and names the free substitute where one exists.

    python3 scripts/sources.py            # the report
    python3 scripts/sources.py --check    # exit 1 on a citation the register does not know

The check is the part that matters: a link to a publisher is fine when the register
says which work it is and what a reader without a subscription should do instead. A
link the register has never seen is a new dependency that nobody has decided about.
