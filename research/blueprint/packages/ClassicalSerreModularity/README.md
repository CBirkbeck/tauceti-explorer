# Roadmap: Serre's modularity conjecture over ℚ

## Purpose

This roadmap proves Serre's modularity conjecture in its strong form. Let ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) be continuous, odd and absolutely irreducible. Then ρ̄ arises from a normalised newform of weight k(ρ̄), level N(ρ̄) and a character lifting ε(ρ̄): there are such a newform f, a prime λ above p of its coefficient field, and an isomorphism between ρ̄ and the reduction of ρ_{f,λ}. This is Khare–Wintenberger's theorem. Its proof runs through Khare's level-one theorem, and the roadmap also gives the shorter qualitative proof of Dieulefait–Pacetti. Both proofs end in one public statement.

Three other roadmaps use the theorem. Elliptic curve modularity uses its finite-flat weight-two case: an absolutely irreducible residual representation that is finite at p ≥ 5 with cyclotomic determinant comes from a weight-two newform of level N(ρ̄) and trivial character. Modularity of GL₂-type abelian varieties over ℚ uses the strong form. Weight-one modularity uses its descent to weight one: every odd irreducible two-dimensional Artin representation of G_ℚ is the representation attached to a weight-one newform.

The build is organised in three strands.

```text
classical seed (R26):
  prescribed lifts and compatible systems in conductor one
  -> prime estimates and the weight recursion
  -> ordinary and degenerate branches, the terminal weights up to 32
  -> Khare's level-one theorem, Corollary 1.2, and the start (W₁)

classical induction (R27):
  good-dihedral primes and the Chebotarev choice of auxiliary primes
  -> (W_r) ⇒ (L_r) and (L_r) ⇒ (W_{r+1})
  -> raising levels: (D_r) removes the good-dihedral hypothesis
  -> characteristic two and even conductor through Hypothesis (H)
  -> the strong form, its finite-flat export and weight one

modern qualitative proof (R33):
  a weight-two system -> a prescribed dihedral type at an auxiliary prime N
  -> remove the odd level -> change the type at 2 and remove 2
  -> remove N -> the level-one system in characteristic five
  -> the odd-characteristic theorem -> characteristic two
  -> the strong form, through the same refinement as the classical route
```

The roadmap is an application roadmap. It owns the specific arguments of Khare, Khare–Wintenberger and Dieulefait–Pacetti: the weight recursion, the conductor induction, the dyadic reductions, the chain of compatible systems and the weight-one descent. The general machinery comes from its neighbours: Galois representations and their conductors, deformation rings, modularity lifting theorems, potential modularity and compatible systems, Serre weights, weight and level optimisation, and the small-ramification base cases. Every such input is a named target of another roadmap, cited by layer.

Representative signatures are in [`Suggested.lean`](Suggested.lean). That file pins the good-dihedral predicate, the hypotheses (L_r), (W_r) and (D_r), the named mathematical targets over the existing absolute Galois group of ℚ, the prescribed lifts and compatible-system interfaces, the weight-one statements, the prime estimates and the lattice-dependent reductions of the dyadic type change. Objects owned by other roadmaps appear there as typed interfaces, and analytic forms use Tau Ceti’s existing newform carrier. Proof and dependency comparisons are stated in this README.

### Consumers and boundaries

- `EllipticCurveModularity:R29.2` uses the finite-flat weight-two export of R27.6.
- `ModularityAndLanglandsExtensions:ML.1` uses the strong form, the weight-one step for unramified residual representations, Khare's weight-one descent and the odd Artin export of R27.6. The general statement for irregular compatible systems, with Sen–Fontaine unramifiedness, belongs to ML.1. Nothing flows back from ML.1 to this roadmap.
- `EllipticCurveModularityPartIIGL2TypeAbelianVarieties:GT.3` uses the strong form.

### Outside this roadmap

Other base fields, representations of dimension greater than two, the general construction of attached Galois representations, local classifications, deformation theory and modularity lifting theorems are owned by the suppliers above. Katz weight-one forms in residue characteristic two and Edixhoven's strong form at p = 2 are not part of the strong theorem here. Corollary 10.2(i) of Khare–Wintenberger, modularity of GL₂-type abelian varieties over ℚ, follows from Theorem 10.1(i) together with Faltings' isogeny theorem and is outside this roadmap.

## 2. Conventions

### 2.1 Representations

G_ℚ = Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ) carries its Krull topology. Fix embeddings ℚ̄ → ℂ and, for every prime p, ι_p : ℚ̄ → ℚ̄_p. A *residual representation* is a continuous homomorphism ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽), 𝔽 a finite field of characteristic p, or its extension to 𝔽̄_p. Continuity means that the kernel is open. *Odd* means det ρ̄(c) = −1 for a complex conjugation c; in characteristic two it is automatic. Irreducibility over an algebraically closed field is absolute irreducibility. A residual representation is *of S-type* if it is continuous, odd and absolutely irreducible.

Lemma 8.2 of Khare–Wintenberger (R27.1), and the insertion step that applies it, are the only statements in the roadmap whose coefficients must be the prime field 𝔽_p. Every use of it first arranges an 𝔽_p-valued representation, by choosing the coefficient prime to split completely in the coefficient field.

Always distinguish the inertia group I_q, the decomposition group D_q and their images in PGL₂. The *projective image* of ρ̄ is the image of G_ℚ in PGL₂(𝔽̄_p).

### 2.2 Serre's invariants

- N(ρ̄) is the Artin conductor of ρ̄ away from p, a positive integer prime to p; *level* means N(ρ̄).
- k(ρ̄) is Serre's weight, defined by his local recipe at p, with k(ρ̄) ≥ 2. For p = 2, k(ρ̄) ∈ {2, 4}, and k(ρ̄) = 4 exactly when ρ̄|_{D₂} is *très ramifiée*.
- ε(ρ̄) is the character with det ρ̄ = ε(ρ̄) χ̄_p^{k(ρ̄)−1}, χ̄_p the mod-p cyclotomic character.
- ρ̄ *arises from* a newform f of weight k if there are a prime λ above p of the coefficient field of f (relative to ι_p) and an integral model of ρ_{f,λ} whose reduction is isomorphic to ρ̄. Conductor N(ρ̄) = 1 does not say that the p-adic lift is unramified at p.
- ρ̄ is *modular* if it arises from a newform of some weight k ≥ 2 and some level. Dieulefait–Pacetti phrase modularity with an eigenform in S_k(Γ₀(N), ε), k ≥ 2; R33.6 proves the two notions equivalent, so the roadmap has one notion of modularity.

These definitions, and the determinant identity, belong to `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6`, the Artin conductor underlying N(ρ̄) to `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.3`, and the local weight recipe to `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.4`.

### 2.3 Lifts and compatible systems

A *minimal* lift is minimal in the sense of Khare–Wintenberger §5, pp. 8–9 (Diamond §3 for odd p; Khare–Wintenberger (II) §3.3.1 for p = 2). At ℓ ≠ p the map ρ(I_ℓ) → ρ̄(I_ℓ) is bijective, with two exceptions: if ρ̄(I_ℓ) is projectively cyclic of order p, ρ|_{I_ℓ} is the Teichmüller twist of a unipotent lift; if p = 2 and ρ̄|_{D_ℓ} is induced from a wildly ramified character γ of a ramified quadratic extension L of ℚ_ℓ, ρ agrees on inertia with the induction of the Teichmüller lift of γ times a ramified quadratic character of G_L. In every case the determinant on inertia is the Teichmüller lift. Minimal lifts preserve the prime-to-p conductor, and away from the two exceptions they keep the inertial type of ρ̄ at ℓ. It is stronger than "unramified wherever ρ̄ is unramified", and the type-preservation steps of R33 need the stronger notion.

An *almost strictly compatible system* is a system (ρ_λ) over a number field E as in Khare–Wintenberger §5, p. 8, and Dieulefait–Pacetti Definition 1.10 with the paragraph after Remark 3, pp. 6–7: a fixed finite ramification set, Weil–Deligne parameters at each ℓ that do not depend on the coefficient place away from ℓ, and the matching p-adic Hodge-theoretic condition at coefficient places above ℓ itself, with the stated exceptions for reducible residual members. Each member may also ramify at its own coefficient prime. The targets of R33.3 and R33.5 say which clause each step uses; in particular, an odd unramified prime ℓ of the system gives a crystalline member at ℓ even when its residual reduction is reducible, while at a ramified coefficient prime with reducible reduction only the de Rham condition is available. Irreducibility of every characteristic-zero member does not imply irreducibility of its residual reductions: residual reducibility after a change of prime is always a branch of the proof.

### 2.4 Numerical conventions

Q(n) is Mathlib's `Nat.maxPrimeFac`: Q(1) = 1, and Q(n) is the greatest prime divisor of n for n > 1. π(x) is `Nat.primeCounting ⌊x⌋₊`. In Khare's recursion p₀ (or p_n) is the previous characteristic bound, P = P_{n+1} the new characteristic, ℓ the *foil* prime, ℓ^e = 2m + 1 the exact odd prime-power divisor of P − 1, and j the tame exponent of the nebentypus at P. In Khare–Wintenberger's hypotheses r counts the odd conductor primes, or bounds the dyadic conductor valuation; r and e are unrelated. In the modern strand q is the coefficient characteristic and N an auxiliary rational prime, not the level N(ρ̄). The printed constant 1.46 with a repeating bar is 22/15.

### 2.5 Local types

ℚ_{N²} is the unramified quadratic extension of ℚ_N, with residue field 𝔽_{N²}. A character of I_N has *niveau 2* if it factors through 𝔽_{N²}^× and not through 𝔽_N^×. A residual ρ̄ is *bad dihedral* if it is irreducible but becomes reducible over ℚ(√p*), p* = (−1)^{(p−1)/2}p; equivalently over ℚ(ζ_p) (`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.4`).

## 3. Starting points in the libraries

Use Mathlib `082e2d37e8b0463410cdb532e111cd43d5a66174` and Tau Ceti `f790474821cf4256814db967cb154e7af3d0c369`. The following declarations are used as they stand.

In Tau Ceti, `HeckeRing.GL2.Newform` has level and weight parameters, a nebentypus character, newness and normalisation a₁ = 1, and `AbelianVariety` is a proper geometrically integral group scheme over a field. Neither is redefined by the roadmap; `Suggested.lean` bundles the existing `HeckeRing.GL2.Newform N k` over positive levels and weights; its residual and characteristic-zero Galois attachments are supplied separately by their owning roadmaps. Neither library contains residual Galois representations with their conductor and Serre weight, compatible systems, or any of the theorems below.

The local character and tame-group adapters also build on the existing Tau Ceti roadmaps LocalGaloisGroups (Layer 0, `localCyclotomicCharacter`), LocalFieldsRamification (tame frame), and ClassFieldTheory (local reciprocity). The cyclotomic character and local field infrastructure are imported inputs to the two-dimensional constructions, not targets to rebuild here.

## 4. Construction order

The layers keep the identifiers R26.1–R33.6 by which neighbouring roadmaps cite them. No target of R27.1 depends on R26. Three of them are needed early: the definition of a good-dihedral prime, Lemma 6.3 and the Chebotarev choice of Lemma 8.2. They use only `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`–`R01.4`, `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.4`, `PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.6` and Chebotarev Layer 10. Build them, together with the definitions (L_r), (W_r), (D_r) of `R27.2/hypotheses-Lr-Wr-and-Dr`, before Corollary 8.1(ii) in R26.6, which uses both definitions. The other two R27.1 targets, the insertion of a good-dihedral prime and the Dickson–Lemma 6.2 package, are first needed in R27.4.

The modern qualitative proof R33.1–R33.5 uses no target of R26 or of R27.2–R27.6. From the classical strand it uses only the three early R27.1 targets. The strong form of R33.6 uses from the classical strand only R27.4's passage from modularity to weight and level. That passage needs Khare–Wintenberger Theorems 4.1 and 5.1(1), Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2(i) from R27.1, θ-operators, Edixhoven's weight theorem and the Deligne–Serre lemma, and no part of the conductor induction. The comparison of the two routes in R33.6 uses, in addition, the classical theorem of R27.6.

Every target below carries a label such as `R26.3/weight-interval-containment`, its layer and a short name. Prerequisites written with such a label are targets of this roadmap; those written `Roadmap:Layer/target` or `Roadmap:Layer` are targets of a neighbouring roadmap; those written in code font without a colon are existing declarations.

## 5. Layers

### Layer R26.1: The level-one statement and the deformation contract

*Milestone:* Khare's level-one theorem.

This layer states the level-one theorem, the prime-conductor corollary that the conductor induction starts from, and the exact form in which Böckle's presentation enters. Their proofs are assembled in R26.6.

**Khare's level-one theorem** (`R26.1/level-one-theorem-and-the-meaning-of-arises-from`). Let ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽) be continuous, absolutely irreducible and odd, 𝔽 finite of characteristic p, and unramified outside p, so N(ρ̄) = 1. Then ρ̄ arises from a cuspidal eigenform of level SL₂(ℤ) and weight k(ρ̄), relative to the fixed embedding ι_p, in the sense of §2.2: an integral model ρ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝒪) of ρ_f, 𝒪 the integers of a finite extension of ℚ_p, reduces to ρ̄. The p-adic lift need not be unramified at p. The cases p = 2 and p = 3 are Tate's and Serre's theorems and are imported; the proof assumes p odd. Only two kinds of modularity lifting input are used: a lift crystalline at p of weight k ≤ p + 1, ordinary when k = p + 1, or a lift with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1} that becomes Barsotti–Tate over ℚ_p(μ_p). No other base field or rank is in scope.

Prerequisites: `R26.6/level-one-proof-assembly`; `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6`.
Suggested name: `level_one`.

**Prime conductor and weight two** (`R26.1/corollary-1-2-conductor-a-prime-and-its-corrected-proof`). Let ρ̄ be odd, irreducible, two-dimensional, with k(ρ̄) = 2 and N(ρ̄) = q a prime. Then ρ̄ arises from S₂(Γ₁(q)). Khare states this for p > 2; Khare–Wintenberger Corollary 8.1(i) includes p = 2. The corrected proof (R26.6) disposes of dihedral projective image by Lemma 6.2 and of q = 2 by the earlier Annals theorem, then works with a minimal weight-two compatible system whose q-adic member is either semistable with nonzero monodromy or crystalline over ℚ_q(μ_q). The reference [KW-I] gives for that last step is Theorem 6.1(2) of the published Duke version of [Kh]; the arXiv preprint has no Theorem 5.1 or 6.1 (its compatible-system result is Proposition 3.1), so the step is specified mathematically in R26.6 rather than by that number. Theorem 5.1(3) of the published paper alone does not cover p ∤ q − 1.

Prerequisites: `R26.6/corollary-1-2-proof`; `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6`.
Suggested name: `conductor_prime_weight_two`.

**Böckle's presentation as the level-one proof applies it** (`R26.1/bockle-appendix-minimal-deformation-ring-presentation`). Böckle's presentation of a global deformation ring with local conditions, his criterion that a finite 𝒪-algebra presented by no more relations than variables is a finite flat complete intersection, and his deduction of R_∅ ≅ T_∅ from an auxiliary R_Q ≅ T_Q are targets of `PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.3`, with the generic presentation in `GlobalGaloisDeformations:R04.3`. This target verifies their hypotheses for the minimal ring R_∅ and the Q-new rings R_Q^{α-new} of the level-one argument:

1. ρ̄ is odd; the Euler-characteristic count in the presentation uses oddness once.
2. The local defect Δ_ℓ vanishes in the four cases used: no ramification at ℓ, no condition at ℓ, the minimal condition at a prime where ρ̄ ramifies, and the Q-new condition at a prime of Q, where the local ring is 𝒪⟦T⟧. At p, Δ_p = 0 for the finite or Selmer conditions, except when ρ̄|_{G_p} is decomposable and flat; there the flat lifts with the given determinant are reducible, the tangent space has dimension 2, and the local ring is W(k)⟦X₁, X₂⟧.
3. If R_Q is finite over 𝒪, then R_∅ is a finite flat complete intersection.
4. The deduction R_∅ ≅ T_∅ needs T_Q and T_∅ finite flat over W(k), T_Q reduced by the choice of Q, and Carayol's theorem that a newform unramified at the primes of Q has conductor prime to Q.

The determinant convention fixes d and Ad_X: d = 0 and Ad⁰ if the determinant is fixed, otherwise d = 1 and Ad.

### Layer R26.2: Prescribed lifts in conductor one

*Milestones:* lifts with prescribed nebentypus; compatible systems through potential modularity.

Every lift of this layer is an application of the prescribed-lift and compatible-system theorems of `PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.3`–`R24.6`; the targets verify their local hypotheses in the cases the level-one proof needs. Throughout, 2 ≤ k(ρ̄) ≤ p + 1 and k(ρ̄) ≠ p, and the unframed relative dimension of the local ring at p is h⁰(D_p, Ad⁰ρ̄) + 1.

**Flatness of the deformation rings of prescribed lifts** (`R26.2/lifting-method-flatness`). Let p be odd and ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽) odd and irreducible with non-solvable image, with 2 ≤ k(ρ̄) ≤ p + 1 and k(ρ̄) ≠ p. Let R be the deformation ring of lifts with fixed determinant, unramified outside a fixed finite set, with prescribed local conditions. Suppose (a) each local ring R_ℓ (ℓ ≠ p) is a flat complete intersection over 𝒪 of relative dimension h⁰(D_ℓ, Ad⁰ρ̄), and R_p one of relative dimension h⁰(D_p, Ad⁰ρ̄) + 1, and (b) R/(π) is finite. Then R is finite flat and a complete intersection over 𝒪, and in particular ρ̄ has a lift of the prescribed type. Finiteness of R/(π) comes from a totally real Galois field F of even degree over which ρ̄ becomes modular (Taylor), R_F ≅ T_F, and the equality of the orders of the inertia images, which makes ρ_R|_{G_F} a specialisation of ρ_{R_F}. For p = 3 an auxiliary prime handles non-neatness.

**Minimal weight-two lifts of ordinary representations** (`R26.2/minimal-weight-two-lift`). Let p > 3 and ρ̄ odd absolutely irreducible, ordinary at p, with 2 ≤ k(ρ̄) ≤ p + 1 and k(ρ̄) ≠ p. Then ρ̄ has a lift ρ that is minimal at every ℓ ≠ p, has determinant ε ω_p^{k(ρ̄)−2} χ_p, and satisfies ρ|_{I_p} ≅ (ω_p^{k−2}χ_p, ∗; 0, 1) when ρ̄|_{I_p} ≅ (χ̄_p^{k−1}, ∗; 0, 1); it is Barsotti–Tate when k(ρ̄) = 2. For 2 < k < p + 1 the tame character ω_p^{k−2} is nontrivial and the lift becomes Barsotti–Tate over ℚ_p(μ_p); at the endpoint k = p + 1 the conductor-one induction uses the semistable weight-two branch. If the image is solvable, Serre's conjecture is known in refined form, and Gross and Edixhoven place an ordinary mod p eigenform of weight k(ρ̄) in S₂(Γ₁(N) ∩ Γ₀(p), ω^{k(ρ̄)−2}); otherwise apply the previous target with the smooth ordinary local ring at p of relative dimension 1 + h⁰(D_p, Ad⁰ρ̄).

**Smoothness of the local ring at an auxiliary prime** (`R26.2/local-ring-at-q-smooth`). Let p and q be distinct odd primes with p^e ∥ q − 1, e > 0. Suppose ρ̄|_{I_q} ≅ (χ̄, ∗; 0, 1) is ramified, χ̄ a mod p character of Gal(ℚ_q(μ_q)/ℚ_q) with Teichmüller lift χ, and put η_q = ω_q^{(q−1)/p^e}. Enlarge 𝒪 to contain the values of χ and η_q. The versal ring R_q of lifts of ρ̄|_{D_q} with determinant ε χ_p^{k(ρ̄)−1} η_q^i and ρ|_{I_q} ≅ (χη_q^i, ∗; 0, 1) is smooth over 𝒪 of relative dimension h⁰(D_q, Ad⁰ρ̄) = 1.
Proof outline: the mod-π tangent space has dimension 1. Lifts are tame, given by the images A of a Frobenius σ_q and B of a tame generator τ_q with ABA⁻¹ = B^q. If χ ≠ 1, take diagonal lifts. If χ = 1 and χ′ = η_q^i ≠ 1, with ρ̄(σ) = (r_F, b; 0, r_F) and ρ̄(τ) = (1, 1; 0, 1), look for A = (α, γ; 0, β) and B = (χ′(τ), 1; 0, 1). As B has order dividing q − 1 the relation is AB = BA, that is α − β = γ(χ′(τ) − 1); with αβ = ψ this gives β² + βγ(χ′(τ) − 1) − ψ = 0. Its derivative reduces to 2r_F, a unit for p odd, and Hensel's lemma gives a one-parameter family. If χ′ = 1 this is Taylor's computation.

**Lifts with prescribed nebentypus at an auxiliary prime** (`R26.2/nebentype-lift-at-q`). Let p be odd and ρ̄ odd irreducible with non-solvable image, 2 ≤ k(ρ̄) ≤ p + 1, k(ρ̄) ≠ p, with ρ̄|_{I_q} as in the previous target. For every integer i there is a lift ρ with determinant ε χ_p^{k(ρ̄)−1} η_q^i, minimal outside {p, q}, crystalline of weight k(ρ̄) at p, and with ρ|_{I_q} ≅ (χη_q^i, ∗; 0, 1). The level-one proof uses it only for k(ρ̄) = 2, ρ̄ unramified outside {p, q} and nontrivial nebentypus. The crystalline local ring at p is checked case by case: the irreducible Fontaine–Laffaille export for k ≤ p, the ramified or distinguished ordinary export, and the endpoint export for weight p + 1 with compatible determinant.

**Placing the lifts in compatible systems** (`R26.2/compatible-system-lifts`).
(i) Let p > 3, ρ̄ as in the minimal weight-two target and ρ a minimal weight-two lift. There is a weakly compatible system (ρ_λ) over a number field E containing ρ at the place given by ι_p. Its member at a place above a prime ℓ > 2 unramified in ρ̄ is Barsotti–Tate at ℓ, unramified outside {ℓ} ∪ Ram(ρ̄), and has the inertial Weil–Deligne parameter of ρ at p.
(ii) Let p be odd (p = 3 allowed), ρ̄ with non-solvable image, k(ρ̄) = 2, and the lift of the previous target with nontrivial nebentypus χη_q^i = ω_q^j, 1 ≤ j ≤ q − 2. There is such a system whose member above q is unramified outside {q} ∪ (Ram(ρ̄) ∖ {p}), unramified at p and Barsotti–Tate over ℚ_q(μ_q). If its residual representation has non-solvable image, its Serre weight is j + 2, or else the twist by χ_q^{−j} has Serre weight q + 1 − j.
Proof outline: Taylor's potential modularity over a Galois totally real field F, Brauer's induction 1 = Σ n_i Ind χ_i over solvable subextensions, and Arthur–Clozel base change give ρ as a virtual sum Σ n_i Ind(χ_i ⊗ ρ_{π_i}), which is a true representation at the other places too. For (i) Taylor's field is unramified at p and the form is ordinary or Steinberg at p. For (ii) use a solvable extension completing to ℚ_q(μ_q), Breuil's theorem on finite flat reductions, level raising to a form square-integrable at an auxiliary place, Saito's local-global compatibility for the inertial parameter, and Breuil–Mézard and Savitt for the weights.

### Layer R26.3: Prime estimates and the weight recursion

*Milestone:* the weight induction for level one.

The prime estimates are owned here and shared with the conductor induction of R27.2. Khare's uniform Chebyshev-type bound is not used: it is false as printed (§7). The replacement route is an explicit form of the prime number theorem with exact thresholds, a finite certified table, and an asymptotic consecutive-prime ratio.

**Explicit prime counting** (`R26.3/explicit-prime-counting-input`). For real x, with π(x) = `Nat.primeCounting ⌊x⌋₊`:
- π(x) > x/log x for x ≥ 17;
- π(x) < 1.25506 x/log x for x > 1;
- π(x) > x/(log x − 1/2) for x ≥ 67;
- π(x) < x/(log x − 3/2) for x > e^{3/2}.

These are the four inequalities (3.3)–(3.6) of Rosser–Schoenfeld; their proof is the analytic argument of that paper with its finite verifications. Comparing a lower bound for π(ap) with an upper bound for π(p) produces a prime in (p, ap]. Khare's bound A x/log x ≤ π(x) ≤ B x/log x for x > 30 with A ≈ 0.921 and B/A = 6/5 fails at x = 31 (π(31) = 11), so it appears here only as a conditional comparison on a stated range.

**The consecutive-prime ratio** (`R26.3/next-prime-ratio`). If p ≥ 31 is prime and P is the least prime greater than p, then P/p < 22/15, so P/p ≤ 3/2 − 1/30. If p ≥ 21591, each of the next two primes after p is at most 61/50 times its predecessor; since (61/50)² = 3721/2500 < 1499/1000, the least non-Fermat prime greater than p is less than (1499/1000)p.
Proof outline: with a = 22/15 compare π(ap) > ap/log(ap) with π(p) < 1.25506 p/log p, checking a log p > 1.25506(log p + log a) at p = 31 and monotonicity. For a = 61/50 and p ≥ 21591 use the sharper denominators. Of two consecutive odd primes above 5 at most one is a Fermat prime, because between two Fermat primes Bertrand's postulate gives another prime.

**The finite auxiliary-prime table** (`R26.3/finite-auxiliary-prime-checks`). For each prime p with 5 ≤ p ≤ 21591 let P be the least non-Fermat prime greater than p. There are an odd prime ℓ and e ≥ 1 with ℓ^e ∥ P − 1, ℓ^e = 2m + 1 and (m + 1)P + m ≤ (2m + 1)p. For p ≤ 31 the triples (p, P, ℓ^e) are (5, 7, 3), (7, 11, 5), (11, 13, 3), (13, 19, 9), (17, 19, 9), (19, 23, 11), (23, 29, 7), (29, 31, 5), (31, 37, 9). At p = 251 the Fermat prime 257 is skipped and P = 263, ℓ^e = 131. The check is a sieve up to 21649 with primality certificates for each P and factorisation certificates for P − 1, decided against `Nat.Prime`.

**Khare's prime estimate** (`R26.3/chebyshev-next-prime`). For every prime p_n ≥ 31 there are a prime P_{n+1} > p_n that is not a Fermat prime (P_{n+1} = p_{n+1}, or p_{n+2} when p_{n+1} is a Fermat prime) and an odd prime power ℓ^e = 2m + 1 exactly dividing P_{n+1} − 1, with ℓ ≤ p_n and

  P_{n+1}/p_n ≤ (2m + 1)/(m + 1) − (m/(m + 1))(1/p_n).   (1)

For p_n ≤ 21591 this is the finite table. For larger p_n the ratio bound gives P/p < 1499/1000 ≤ 3/2 − 1/p, and the right side of (1) is at least 3/2 − 1/p for m ≥ 1. As P is not a Fermat prime, P − 1 has an exact odd prime-power divisor, and every odd prime factor of P − 1 is at most (P − 1)/2 < p. The finite range also supplies p = 5, 7, …, 29. Khare–Wintenberger §7, case (i), uses the same estimate.

**Twisting the Serre weight** (`R26.3/serre-weight-twist`). Let τ : G_{ℚ_p} → GL₂(𝔽) have Serre weight k ≠ 2 with k < p. If τ is irreducible and k − 1 = p − k′ with k′ ≥ 0, then τ ⊗ χ̄_p^{k′} has weight k′ + 2 = p + 3 − k. If τ|_{I_p} is split, τ ⊗ χ̄_p^{1−k} has weight p + 1 − k. This is read off Serre's recipe.

**The new weights fall into the known range** (`R26.3/weight-interval-containment`). Let p_n ≥ 31 and P = P_{n+1} > p_n be odd primes and ℓ^e = 2m + 1 ∥ P − 1, ℓ an odd prime, e ≥ 1, satisfying (1); put L = (P − 1)/ℓ^e, a positive integer. For every integer j with mL < j ≤ (m + 1)L, both j + 2 and P + 1 − j lie in [2, p_n + 1]. The half-open interval (mL, (m + 1)L] contains exactly one integer in each residue class modulo L, so the nebentypus χη_P^i can be chosen with j in it: choose the representative of the coset of the original tame exponent. Both upper bounds are equivalent to (m + 1)P ≤ (2m + 1)p_n − m, that is to (1).

**The well-founded induction on the weight bound** (`R26.3/level-one-induction-scheme`). For B ≥ 2 let S(B) say: every odd irreducible ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_s), in every characteristic s, with N(ρ̄) = 1 and k(ρ̄) ≤ B, is modular. Then S(32) holds (R26.5), and S(p_n + 1) implies S(P_{n+1} + 1) for the primes p_n ≥ 31 of the prime estimate. In the step every recursive appeal is to weight at most p_n + 1, to weight two at level one (excluded, so the representation is reducible), or to solvable image (known). The induction is on the bound B, not on the prime: changing to the foil prime and back does not change B.
The step first proves the full level-one theorem in characteristic P: weights ≤ p_n + 1 come from S(p_n + 1), and the new normalised weights p_n + 2 ≤ k ≤ P + 1 from the step. Only then does Corollary 5.5(ii) export S(P + 1) to every characteristic. Corollary 5.5(i) moves a fixed weight k ≤ p + 1 only to characteristics q ≥ k − 1, so a bounded statement in one characteristic does not suffice. Cyclotomic normalisation and its undoing come from Serre's recipe; characteristics 2 and 3 are Tate's and Serre's.

### Layer R26.4: Ordinary and degenerate branches

Each change of prime can produce a residual representation that is reducible, bad dihedral, or solvable but cyclotomically absolutely irreducible. These are three different branches, with three different lifting theorems. The bad-dihedral branch, in the level-one lifting lemma and in the degenerate branches, rests on Skinner–Wiles' nearly ordinary lifting for residuals induced from ℚ(√p*); for p ≡ 3 (mod 4) that field is imaginary. This case of nearly ordinary lifting, which Khare–Wintenberger take from Skinner's unpublished correction to Skinner–Wiles, is required of `OrdinaryAutomorphicFormsAndModularityLifting:R21.5/nearly-ordinary-irreducible-lifting-over-q`.

**Residually reducible potentially Barsotti–Tate lifts are ordinary** (`R26.4/local-reducibility-ordinary`). Let p be odd and V a two-dimensional potentially crystalline representation of G_{ℚ_p} with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1}. Suppose that after a Teichmüller twist WD(V)|_{I_p} ≅ ω_p^i ⊕ 1 with 1 ≤ i ≤ p − 2, and let T be any G_{ℚ_p}-stable lattice over a large enough coefficient ring. If T modulo its maximal ideal is reducible, then V is reducible and ordinary up to a power of ω_p. Nothing is claimed for other potentially Barsotti–Tate types, and no End(ρ̄) = 𝔽 hypothesis is needed.
Proof outline: in Breuil–Mézard's parametrisation V(μ, ξ), an intermediate slope 0 < v_p(ξ) < 1 gives an irreducible residual representation of niveau two. A reducible lattice therefore forces slope 0 or 1, the two reducible endpoints, which are ordinary after a Teichmüller twist and related by twist and Cartier duality. Savitt's integral classification gives the same answer; for lattices without trivial endomorphisms use his description of the semisimplification (Remark 6.17), as reducibility in dimension two is reducibility of the semisimplification.

Prerequisites: `FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory:R07.5`.

**Level-one lifting and the change of prime** (`R26.4/level-one-lifting-lemma`). Let p be odd and ρ an irreducible p-adic representation unramified outside p, crystalline at p with Hodge–Tate weights (k − 1, 0), k even with 2 ≤ k ≤ p + 1, with ρ̄ modular. Then ρ arises from S_k(SL₂(ℤ)). Consequently:
(i) if every odd irreducible mod p representation of level one and weight k ≤ p + 1 is modular, so is every such representation mod q of weight k, for every prime q ≥ k − 1;
(ii) the level-one theorem mod one prime p > 2 gives it mod every prime q for weights ≤ p + 1.
Proof outline: if ρ̄ is irreducible but reducible over ℚ(√p*), Wintenberger's lemma makes ρ̄|_{I_p} ordinary and distinguished, and nearly ordinary lifting applies; otherwise the lifting theorems of Wiles, Taylor–Wiles, Diamond and Skinner–Wiles apply, except non-ordinary weight p + 1, which Berger–Li–Zhu (Corollary 4.1.3) exclude because it would make ρ̄|_{D_p} irreducible of weight two, impossible at level one. For Corollary 5.5, first remove dihedral and bad-dihedral residuals with theta-series modularity and the exact weight and level theorem; then the residual restriction to G_{ℚ(μ_q)} is absolutely irreducible. Take the crystalline minimal lift of weight k and its general-weight compatible system (a weight-two system does not suffice), check the residual weight at p, apply the first statement and transfer along the system. The scalar crystalline input at the foil uses k = 2 < p.

**The degenerate branches of the level-one step** (`R26.4/degenerate-branches`). In the inductive step at P let ρ be the irreducible minimal weight-two lift, ρ̄_ℓ its residual member at the foil ℓ, and ρ″ the P-adic member of the second system.
(a) If ρ̄_ℓ has solvable image, separate three cases. If it is reducible, its Barsotti–Tate lift is ordinary and distinguished and residually reducible ordinary lifting applies. If it is irreducible but reducible on G_{ℚ(μ_ℓ)}, the general bad-dihedral weight lemma excludes local irreducibility in weight two (it would force weight (ℓ + 3)/2), so the distinguished ordinary branch applies. If it is absolutely irreducible on that restriction, solvable residual modularity and a potentially Barsotti–Tate lifting theorem apply; solvability alone does not give ordinarity.
(b) If ρ̄_ℓ is unramified at P, it has weight two and level one and is therefore reducible; the ordinary branch applies.
(c) At the return member, local residual reducibility at P makes ρ″ ordinary up to a Teichmüller twist by the nonscalar local classification, distinguished because j is even. Globally irreducible bad-dihedral return residuals have level one and are ordinary by the level-one dihedral classification; cyclotomically absolutely irreducible solvable ones use solvable modularity and potentially Barsotti–Tate lifting.
At the foil ℓ the residual representation may be ramified at both ℓ and P, so the general normalised-weight form of the bad-dihedral lemma is used there, not the level-one classification. For the scalar crystalline weight-two lift at ℓ, Breuil–Mézard Proposition 4.1.1 with k = 2 < ℓ shows that an irreducible characteristic-zero branch has irreducible reduction; otherwise the ordinary characters reduce to χ̄_ℓ and 1, which differ for ℓ odd. Before applying an ordinary lifting theorem, check irreducibility of the characteristic-zero lift, the ordinary local shape and distinct residual inertia characters.

**Ordinary reduction and residual distinction** (`R26.4/ordinary-reduction-and-parity`). At level one k is even. In the step with previous bound p₀ + 1 and new characteristic P, p₀ + 2 ≤ k ≤ P + 1: a locally irreducible representation with k < P has a cyclotomic twist of weight P + 3 − k, and a locally split one a twist of weight P + 1 − k; the auxiliary-prime inequality puts both weights in the proved range. What remains is ordinary, including k = P + 1. The ordinary weight-two lift has inertial characters whose residual ratio is nontrivial, because k − 1 is odd and P − 1 is even. At a return member with even tame exponent j, 1 ≤ j ≤ P − 2, the same parity gives the distinguished hypothesis after the Teichmüller twist. The twist formulas need k ≠ 2 and k < P; k = P + 1 is treated by its ordinary classification.

### Layer R26.5: The terminal weights up to 32

The recursion of R26.3 starts at 31, so the even weights up to 32 are proved directly. Weights 2, 4 and 6 come from the earlier Khare–Wintenberger Annals theorem ([KW-Ann], Theorems 5.2 and 5.4), which rests on the results of Fontaine, Schoof and Brumer–Kramer on semistable abelian varieties over ℚ with small ramification; characteristics 2 and 3 are Tate's and Serre's. Odd weights do not occur at level one because of the determinant.

**The terminal-row contract** (`R26.5/terminal-row-branch-contract`). Each row is a triple (P, ℓ, j): P and ℓ distinct odd primes, ℓ^e ∥ P − 1, and an even j with 1 ≤ j ≤ P − 2 and j ≡ k − 2 modulo (P − 1)/ℓ^e. Start with an odd absolutely irreducible level-one mod-P representation of an even weight k of the row. After the local twist reduction it is ordinary; construct its minimal weight-two lift and system. The mod-ℓ member has weight two and is ramified only at ℓ and P. If it is solvable, use the three branches of `R26.4/degenerate-branches`; if it is unramified at P, the level-one weight-two exclusion makes it reducible. Otherwise change its nebentypus at P to ω_P^j, form the second system and return to P. Reducible and solvable return members use local ordinarity and the lifting theorems; non-solvable ones have weight j + 2, or a cyclotomic twist of weight P + 1 − j, both already proved: by an earlier row, or, for weights 2, 4 and 6, by the Annals theorem. Undo the twist, lift modularity, transfer at ℓ and then to the initial representation, and optimise its weight and level. At each transition check the full determinant and local type, not only the weights. At the endpoint k = P + 1 the minimal weight-two lift is semistable at P, so the mod-ℓ member is unipotent on I_P and the admissible exponent coset is 0.

The five rows are separate targets. Each proves every odd absolutely irreducible level-one representation of the listed weights modular, first in characteristic P; together with the earlier rows this gives the full level-one theorem in characteristic P up to that weight, and only then Corollary 5.5(ii) exports the bound to every characteristic.

At P = 29 the coset condition is modulo (29 − 1)/7 = 4: k − 2 = 20, 24, 28 give exponent 0 modulo 4 and k − 2 = 22, 26 give 2 modulo 4, whence j = 16 and j = 14. At P = 31 the minimal weight-two lift of a weight-32 representation is semistable at 31, so the mod-5 member is unipotent on I₃₁ and the nebentypus must be ω₃₁^{6i}; j = 18 lies in the interval (12, 18] and is divisible by 6 (Khare prints 16; see §7). In the row for weights 22–30 the mod-7 companion is ramified only at 7 and 29.

### Layer R26.6: The level-one theorem and the start of the conductor induction

*Milestone:* assembly of the level-one proof.

**Proof of the level-one theorem** (`R26.6/level-one-proof-assembly`). In the inductive step the second compatible system (ρ′_λ) is modular: its P-adic member has residual weight at most p_n + 1, or falls into a degenerate branch. It is linked to the first system (ρ_λ) at the place above ℓ, where both have the same non-solvable residual representation. Modularity lifting makes (ρ_λ) modular, so ρ̄ is modular of some weight and level, hence of weight k(ρ̄) and level 1 by Ribet's and Edixhoven's optimisation. With S(32) this proves S(B) for all B. The two systems add no fixed Weil–Deligne ramification at ℓ: their ℓ-adic lifts are crystalline of weight two, although a member may ramify at its own coefficient prime. Linked-system transfer is applied only after its residual and local hypotheses are checked.

**Proof of Corollary 1.2** (`R26.6/corollary-1-2-proof`). The statement of `R26.1/corollary-1-2-conductor-a-prime-and-its-corrected-proof` holds for all p.
- q = 2. A prime-to-p conductor forces p odd. Conductor exponent one at 2 means one-dimensional inertia invariants and zero Swan conductor; the tame character on the quotient is Frobenius-stable, so χ = χ² and χ = 1, and the inertia image is unipotent of p-power order. With k = 2 this is semistability in the sense of [KW-Ann] Definition 4.1. Then [KW-Ann] Theorem 5.2(ii) excludes the case: reducible cyclotomic restriction is handled by dihedral modularity and optimisation; otherwise Theorem 4.2(ii) realises a minimal weight-two system in a GL₂-type abelian variety of positive dimension with good reduction outside 2 and semistable reduction at 2, which Schoof's theorem forbids.
- q odd. Take the minimal weight-two system. Its Weil–Deligne parameter at q is either semistable with nonzero monodromy or unramified after restriction to ℚ_q(μ_q); correspondingly its q-adic member is semistable of weight two (Saito) or becomes crystalline of weight two over ℚ_q(μ_q). Its residual representation is unramified outside q, so the level-one theorem, or the reducible convention, gives residual modularity. The lifting step is Theorem 6.1(2) of the published Duke version of [Kh] together with Skinner–Wiles (with Skinner's correction for the residually dihedral case), using Saito's theorem in the semistable case. Transfer along the system and optimise to weight two and level Γ₁(q).
Killing ramification is a method with lifting hypotheses ([KW-Ann] §6.2), not a licence to remove local ramification.

**Finiteness of level-one representations** (`R26.6/finiteness-corollary-1-3`). For each prime p there are finitely many isomorphism classes of continuous semisimple odd representations G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) unramified outside p. In the absolutely irreducible case, normalise the weight by one of finitely many cyclotomic twists, apply the level-one theorem and realise the form in S₂(Γ₁(p²)); the integral Hecke algebra there is finite over ℤ and has finitely many mod-p eigencharacters, and the residual representations are determined by their Frobenius traces. A finite complex dimension alone is not enough. In the reducible semisimple case ρ̄ is a sum of two characters unramified outside p; by Kronecker–Weber they factor through the prime-to-p quotient of ℤ_p^×, so their order divides p − 1 (they are trivial when p = 2).

**Corollary 8.1(ii) and the initial case (W₁)** (`R26.6/corollary-8-1-ii-and-the-statement-W1`). Let ρ̄ be an irreducible odd two-dimensional mod p representation with k(ρ̄) = 2, unramified outside p and one other odd prime q ≠ p, tamely ramified at q, with ρ̄(I_q) of order a power of an odd prime t > 5. Then ρ̄ arises from S₂(Γ₁(q²)). This, not the conductor-one theorem, is the start of the conductor induction: (W₁) concerns locally good-dihedral representations of weight two whose odd conductor has one prime divisor, which is exactly this shape.
Proof outline: the case t = p reduces to Corollary 8.1(i); otherwise t is an odd prime greater than 5 and different from p, and tameness gives t ≠ q. A dihedral projective image is handled by Lemma 6.2; A₄ and S₄ reduce to level one because t > 5. Build an almost strictly compatible lift by Theorem 5.1(1): ρ_p unramified outside {p, q}, crystalline of weight two at p, with |ρ_p(I_q)| = |ρ̄_p(I_q)|. Look at the mod-t member ρ̄_t. If it is reducible, or unramified at q (which forces reducibility by the level-one weight-two case), Skinner–Wiles makes ρ_t modular; ρ_t is crystalline of weight two since t ≠ 2. If ρ̄_t is irreducible and ramified at q, then k(ρ̄_t) = 2, the ramification at q is unipotent, Corollary 8.1(i) gives residual modularity, and Wiles–Taylor–Wiles make ρ_t modular; absolute irreducibility of ρ̄_t over ℚ(μ_t) follows from |ρ̄_t(I_q)| = t or from k(ρ̄_t) = 2 and Lemma 6.2(ii).

### Layer R27.1: Good-dihedral primes and auxiliary primes

*Milestones:* good-dihedral primes; Lemma 8.2, the Chebotarev choice of auxiliary primes.

A good-dihedral prime keeps every residual representation met in the conductor induction, and in the modern proof, large: non-solvable image and projective image different from A₅. The first three targets use nothing from R26 (§4).

**Good-dihedral primes** (`R27.1/good-dihedral-prime-definition`). Let ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) be continuous and write N = N(ρ̄). A prime q ≠ p is a *good-dihedral prime* for ρ̄ if
1. ρ̄|_{I_q} ≅ ψ ⊕ ψ^q for a nontrivial character ψ of I_q whose order is a power of an odd prime t with t | q + 1 and t > max(Q(N/q²), 5, p); and
2. q ≡ 1 (mod 8), and q ≡ 1 (mod s) for every prime s ≤ max(Q(N/q²), p).
ρ̄ is *locally good-dihedral* (for q), or *q-dihedral*, if such a q exists. Since t | q + 1 and t ∤ q − 1, ψ has niveau two at q. The bound on t uses the largest prime of the prime-to-q part of the conductor; the congruences in (2) are what make q split or ramify in every quadratic field unramified outside the ramification of ρ̄ (Lemma 6.3). The predicate refers to N(ρ̄), so it is not stable under arbitrary changes of level. Its purpose: starting from a q-dihedral representation of characteristic P ramified at a set S, the proofs of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 only meet residual representations of characteristic at most max(P, ℓ) over ℓ ∈ S ∖ {q}, which is exactly the range where (1) and (2) are imposed.

Suggested names: `IsGoodDihedralPrime`, `IsLocallyGoodDihedral`, and `IsGoodDihedralRep` for the specialisation to residual representations of G_ℚ.

The suggested predicate is algebraic: it takes a representation ρ : G → GL₂(K), a family of inertia homomorphisms I_q → G, the characteristic p and the conductor N as inputs. For the Galois specialisation p is the characteristic of K, N the actual conductor and the inertia maps the inclusions of inertia groups at chosen primes above q.

API:
- `IsGoodDihedralPrime` — the conjunction: q prime, q ≠ p; t, a and ψ with t an odd prime, a > 0, t | q + 1, the strict size bound, ψ of exact order t^a, and a basis change B with B⁻¹ρ(x)B = diag(ψ(x), ψ(x)^q) on inertia; and the two congruence conditions.
- `IsLocallyGoodDihedral ρ ↔ ∃ q, IsGoodDihedralPrime ρ q`, with `IsGoodDihedralPrime.locallyGood` and `IsLocallyGoodDihedral.exists_good`.
- `IsGoodDihedralPrime.inertia` and `IsGoodDihedralPrime.congruences` extract the two conditions, the second including equality at the upper end s = max(Q(N/q²), p).
- `IsGoodDihedralPrime.conjugate`, `IsLocallyGoodDihedral.conjugate`: replacing ρ by B⁻¹ρB, B ∈ GL₂, changes neither predicate.
- `IsGoodDihedralPrime.q_sq_dvd_conductor`: for an actual residual Galois representation, the niveau-two inertia has no invariants, so the conductor exponent at q is 2 and q² | N(ρ̄).

Tests:
- `goodDihedral_congruence_fails`: q = 13 is never good-dihedral, as 13 ≢ 1 (mod 8).
- `goodDihedral_trivial_inertia_fails`: a representation trivial on I_q is not good-dihedral at q, since ψ must have order t^a with a > 0.
- `goodDihedral_upper_endpoint`: for p = 7, q = 241 and N = 9 · 241², Q(N/q²) = 3; the congruences modulo 8, 2, 3 and 5 hold but 241 ≢ 1 (mod 7), so the predicate fails: the bound s ≤ max(Q(N/q²), p) includes s = p.
- `goodDihedral_basis_change`, `locallyGood_basis_change`: invariance under conjugation, with the witness basis composed with B.
- `locallyGood_single_witness`: one good prime makes ρ locally good-dihedral although 13 never is; this rejects a universal quantifier in place of the existential.
- `locallyGood_trivial_inertia_fails`: trivial inertia at every q excludes local good-dihedrality for every conductor parameter.

**Lemma 6.3: image and propagation** (`R27.1/good-dihedral-implies-nonsolvable-image-and-is-preserved`). Let ρ̄ be locally good-dihedral for q.
(i) The image of ρ̄ is not solvable and its projective image is not A₅.
(ii) Let (ρ_ι) be a compatible system lifting ρ̄ whose fixed Weil–Deligne ramification lies in the primes dividing N(ρ̄)p (each member may also ramify at its own coefficient prime), with ρ_p|_{D_q} a minimal lift of ρ̄|_{D_q}. Then for every prime r ≤ max(Q(N(ρ̄)/q²), p), every mod-r representation ρ̄_r arising from the system is again good-dihedral for q, and so has non-solvable image with projective image other than A₅.
Proof outline: since t | q + 1 and t ∤ q − 1, ρ̄|_{D_q} is irreducible, hence so is ρ̄; t > 5 excludes A₅. If the image were solvable, Dickson's classification makes the projective image dihedral (t > 5 excludes A₄ and S₄), so ρ̄ is induced from a quadratic field K unramified outside the ramification of ρ̄. The congruences of (2) make q split or ramify in K: splitting contradicts irreducibility on D_q, ramification contradicts t odd. For (ii): t exceeds every new residual characteristic r in range, so reduction is bijective on the dihedral projective image D_{2t^a} of the decomposition group at q, in particular on its cyclic inertia part of order t^a; new prime divisors away from q are bounded by max(Q(N/q²), p) through the product and power rules for Q. Only Dickson's classification is used, no modularity or weight statement.

**Lemma 8.2: the Chebotarev choice of auxiliary primes** (`R27.1/lemma-8-2-chebotarev-choice-of-auxiliary-primes`). Let p ≡ 1 (mod 4) be prime and ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽_p), with coefficients in the prime field, continuous, odd, with non-solvable image (so absolutely irreducible). Let c be a complex conjugation. The primes q unramified in ρ̄ with
(i) ρ̄_proj(Frob_q) conjugate to ρ̄_proj(c) in the projective image,
(ii) q ≡ 1 (mod ℓ) for every prime ℓ ≤ p − 1, and q ≡ 1 (mod 8),
(iii) q ≡ −1 (mod p),
have positive Dirichlet density. At such q, tr ρ̄(Frob_q) = 0, p | q + 1, and ρ̄|_{D_q} is an unramified twist of diag(χ̄_p, 1) with χ̄_p(Frob_q) = −1.
The coefficients must be 𝔽_p, not 𝔽̄_p: Khare–Wintenberger record that an earlier version allowed 𝔽̄_p and that a rationality hypothesis may be needed. p ≡ 1 (mod 4) is used twice: when the projective image is PGL₂(𝔽_p), ρ̄_proj(c) lies in PSL₂(𝔽_p) because det ρ̄(c) = −1 is a square; and −1 is a square mod p, which makes (iii) compatible with the other conditions.
Proof outline: by Dickson the projective image is PSL₂(𝔽_p), PGL₂(𝔽_p) or A₅. Let M be the field cut out by ρ̄_proj and C the cyclotomic field generated by μ₈, μ_ℓ for odd ℓ < p, and μ_p. As PSL₂(𝔽_p) and A₅ have no nontrivial abelian quotient, M ∩ C has degree 1 or 2 over ℚ, and in degree 2 it is the fixed field of PSL₂(𝔽_p). The congruence conditions make Frob_q trivial on every quadratic subfield of C (on ℚ(i), ℚ(√±2) by q ≡ 1 mod 8, on ℚ(√ℓ*) by q ≡ 1 mod ℓ, on ℚ(√p) because q ≡ −1 mod p and −1 is a square), and condition (i) makes it trivial on M ∩ C. So the conditions define a nonempty union of conjugacy classes of Gal(MC/ℚ), and Chebotarev gives positive density. Finally ρ̄_proj(Frob_q) has order 2, so ρ̄(Frob_q) has eigenvalues α, −α.

**Inserting a good-dihedral prime** (`R27.1/good-dihedral-prime-insertion`). Let p′ > 5 be prime with p′ ≡ 1 (mod 4), ρ̄′ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽_{p′}) of S-type with non-solvable image and k(ρ̄′) = 2, and q a prime given by Lemma 8.2 for ρ̄′. Then p′ | q + 1 and ρ̄′|_{D_q} is, up to an unramified twist, (χ̄_{p′}, ∗; 0, 1). Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 5.1(4) gives an almost strictly compatible system (ρ′_λ) lifting ρ̄′, minimally ramified at primes other than p′ and q, of weight two and crystalline at p′, with ρ′_{p′}|_{I_q} ≅ χ′ ⊕ χ′^q for a character χ′ of I_q of niveau two and p′-power order; such characters exist because p′ is odd. If moreover every prime other than p′ at which ρ̄′ ramifies is smaller than p′, then for every prime s < p′, s ≠ q, the residual representation ρ̄′_s is good-dihedral for q with t = p′, so has non-solvable image. In applications ρ̄′ is the reduction ρ̄_{p′} of a compatible system, and p′ must split completely in its coefficient field so that ρ̄_{p′} is 𝔽_{p′}-valued, as Lemma 8.2 requires.
Proof outline: compatibility at q gives ρ′_s|_{I_q} ≅ χ′ ⊕ χ′^q, and reduction mod s is injective on a group of p′-power order; t = p′ exceeds every other ramified prime and s; the congruences of Lemma 8.2(ii) cover every prime up to p′ − 1. Then apply Lemma 6.3(i).

**Dickson, its dyadic refinement and the dihedral weight lemmas** (`R27.1/dickson-and-the-dyadic-solvable-refinement`). This target collects four statements of Khare–Wintenberger §6 in the form the classical strand applies them; each is proved by its owner.
- Dickson: a finite subgroup of GL₂(𝔽̄_p) acting irreducibly has projective image dihedral, A₄, S₄, A₅, PSL₂(𝔽₀) or PGL₂(𝔽₀) for a finite subfield 𝔽₀; PSL₂(𝔽₀) is simple nonabelian once |𝔽₀| ≥ 4 (`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.4`).
- Lemma 6.1: a finite solvable subgroup of GL₂(𝔽̄₂) acting irreducibly has dihedral projective image. S₄ is excluded because elements of 2-power order in GL₂(𝔽̄₂) have order at most 2; A₄ because its normal subgroup of order 4 would force the group into the upper triangular matrices (`R01.4`).
- Lemma 6.2(i): an S-type ρ̄ with dihedral projective image arises from S_{k(ρ̄)}(Γ₁(N(ρ̄))). At p = 2 this goes through Serre's Proposition 10 method, with the refined weight and level from Wiese (`GL2AutomorphicRepresentationsAndTransfer:R17.5`, `R17.6`, and `SerreWeightAndLevelOptimisation:R20.5` for the exact weight and level).
- Lemma 6.2(ii): if ρ̄ is of S-type, p ≥ 3, 2 ≤ k(ρ̄) ≤ p + 1 and ρ̄|_{G_{ℚ(μ_p)}} is reducible, then k(ρ̄) is (p + 1)/2 or (p + 3)/2. Here ρ̄ is induced from the quadratic subfield of ℚ(μ_p), so for p > 2 its projective image is dihedral of order prime to p and the projective image of inertia at p is cyclic; it has order 2 because that quadratic field is ramified at p (`AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.4`).

### Layer R27.2: The induction hypotheses and weight reduction

*Milestone:* reduction to weight two.

**The hypotheses (L_r), (W_r) and (D_r)** (`R27.2/hypotheses-Lr-Wr-and-Dr`). For r ≥ 1:
- (L_r): every ρ̄ of S-type is modular provided (a) ρ̄ is locally good-dihedral, (b) k(ρ̄) = 2 if p = 2, and (c) N(ρ̄) is odd with at most r prime divisors.
- (W_r): the same with (b) replaced by k(ρ̄) = 2 in every characteristic.
For r ≥ 0:
- (D_r): every ρ̄ of S-type is modular provided (a) ρ̄ is locally good-dihedral, (b) p is odd, and (c) 2^{r+1} ∤ N(ρ̄).
(L_r) implies (W_r). (L_r) and (W_r) require odd conductor; (D_r) allows even conductor with bounded 2-adic valuation and excludes p = 2. All three are restricted to locally good-dihedral representations, which keeps residually degenerate lifting theorems out of the induction beyond their use in the level-one theorem. By Theorem 3.4, (D₀) gives modularity of every S-type ρ̄ of odd characteristic with N(ρ̄) odd, and of characteristic 2 with k(ρ̄) = 2; (D₁) gives it in characteristic 2 and for odd p with 4 ∤ N(ρ̄).

Prerequisites: `R27.1/good-dihedral-prime-definition`; `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6`.

API:
- `HypL r`, `HypW r`, `HypD r` quantify over every prime p and every S-type ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) satisfying the conditions, and conclude `IsModular ρ̄`.
- `hypL_imp_hypW`: (L_r) ⇒ (W_r) by restriction to weight two.
- `hypL_mono`, `hypW_mono`: for 1 ≤ r ≤ s, (L_s) ⇒ (L_r) and (W_s) ⇒ (W_r); the converse is not a consequence of inclusion.
- `hypD_mono`: for r ≤ s, (D_s) ⇒ (D_r), since 2^{r+1} ∤ N implies 2^{s+1} ∤ N.

Tests:
- `hypL_imp_hypW_test`: specialising a proof of (L_r) to a weight-two good-dihedral representation with odd conductor and at most r prime factors gives exactly (W_r).
- `hypD_even_conductor`: N = 2q² (q odd) meets the conductor condition of (D₁) and fails the odd-conductor condition of (L_r) and (W_r); no representation with this conductor is asserted to exist.
- `hyp_count_primes`: for distinct odd primes 3, 5 and q, N = 3 · 5 · q² has three prime factors, so it meets the bound of (L₃), (W₃) and fails that of (L₂), (W₂), whatever the exponent at q.
- `hyp_dyadic_weight`: in characteristic 2, (L_r) admits weight 2 and rejects weight 4; in odd characteristic (L_r) admits both weights and (W_r) rejects weight 4.

**The prime-gap inequalities of the weight reduction** (`R27.2/prime-gap-estimates-driving-the-weight-recursion`). The odd estimate (1) is `R26.3/chebyshev-next-prime` and the ratio bound is `R26.3/next-prime-ratio`. If P − 1 has no odd prime factor, P is a Fermat prime and 2^e ∥ P − 1 with e ≥ 4 (P ≥ 17); the dyadic requirement is

  (2^{e−1} + 2)P + (2^{e−1} − 2) ≤ 2^e p,   (2)

which implies (2^{e−1} + 2)(P − 1) + 2 · 2^e ≤ (p + 1)2^e, inequality (4) of Khare–Wintenberger. Choose an even exponent i in [(P − 1)/2, ((2^{e−1} + 2)/2^e)(P − 1)], an interval of length 2 when P is a Fermat prime; for odd ℓ use the half-open interval of `R26.3/weight-interval-containment`. The inequalities are needed for p ≥ 5; characteristics 3 and 5 are separate cases of Theorem 3.2. For p ≤ 31 the only Fermat case is (p, P, e) = (13, 17, 4), where (2) reads 176 ≤ 208. For p > 31, P/p < 22/15 ≤ 3/2 − 1/p and 2^e/(2^{e−1} + 2) ≥ 3/2 for e ≥ 4. Khare's level-one paper proves the stronger statement that the least non-Fermat prime above p always works.

**Theorem 3.2: (W_r) implies (L_r)** (`R27.2/theorem-3-2-weight-reduction`). For r ≥ 1, (W_r) implies (L_r). Fix r and induct on the residue characteristic p, with ρ̄ locally good-dihedral for q, N(ρ̄) odd with at most r prime divisors. Characteristic 2 is (W_r) itself.
- p = 3. Lift ρ̄ (k(ρ̄) ≤ 4) by Theorem 5.1(2) and reduce at 2: ρ̄₂ is q-dihedral, hence non-solvable, of weight 2 by almost strict compatibility, with N(ρ̄₂) supported on the primes of N(ρ̄) and 3. If ρ̄₂ is unramified at 3, conclude by (W_r) and Theorem 4.1. Otherwise ρ̄₂|_{I₃} is a nontrivial unipotent (ω₃ has order 2), so ρ̄₂|_{D₃} is an unramified twist of (χ̄₂, ∗; 0, 1); apply Theorem 5.1(4) with χ′ = ω_{3,2}². A twist of the new mod-3 member ρ̄′₃ has weight 2, and N(ρ̄′₃) is odd with at most r prime divisors, so (W_r) and Theorem 4.1, applied at 3 and then at 2, conclude.
- p = 5. The same start, with k(ρ̄) ≤ 6. If ρ̄₂ is ramified at 5, its inertia at 5 is a nontrivial unipotent (ω₅ has order 4), and Theorem 5.1(3) with χ′ = ω₅² gives a system whose mod-5 member ρ̄′₅ has weight 4 after a twist and odd conductor with at most r prime divisors. To prove ρ̄′₅ modular, lift it by Theorem 5.1(2) if 3 | N(ρ̄′₅), by Theorem 5.1(1) otherwise, and reduce at 3, where the case p = 3 applies.
- General step (p ≥ 5; ρ̄ of characteristic P, the next prime after p, the statement being known in every characteristic ≤ p). Choose ℓ^e ∥ P − 1 satisfying (1), or (2) when ℓ = 2. Lift ρ̄ by Theorem 5.1(2) and reduce at ℓ: ρ̄_ℓ is q-dihedral, with odd conductor supported on the primes of N(ρ̄) and P. If ρ̄_ℓ is unramified at P, the hypothesis in characteristic ℓ ≤ p and Theorem 4.1 conclude. Otherwise apply Theorem 5.1(3) at the prime P to a twist ρ̄′_ℓ of ρ̄_ℓ by a character unramified outside ℓ (with 2 ≤ k(ρ̄′_ℓ) ≤ ℓ + 1 when ℓ is odd), with χ′ = ω_P^i for i in the interval of the previous target, and reduce the new system at P: the estimates give k(ρ̄′_P) ≤ p + 1 after a twist. The return representation is still in characteristic P, so induction does not yet apply. If p divides its conductor, use the weight-two lift and reduce at p; its prime support lies in that of the prime-to-p part of P · N(ρ̄′_P). If not, use the crystalline lift of that weight and reduce at p, adding no conductor prime. In both cases the odd conductor has at most r prime divisors, the good-dihedral prime persists, and the hypothesis applies in the smaller characteristic p. Transfer modularity back through the three systems and undo the twists.
The foil leaves the fixed ramification: if ℓ ∤ N(ρ̄), the second system is crystalline of weight two at ℓ with unramified Weil–Deligne parameter, so ℓ does not divide the return conductor; almost strict compatibility without this local type is not enough. Every reduction stays below max(Q(N/q²), P), so Lemma 6.3 keeps q good-dihedral. The final reduction at p, not the weight change, lowers the induction variable; r stays fixed and is unrelated to e.

### Layer R27.3: Killing ramification and the double induction

*Milestones:* killing ramification; the initial case (W₁); the (L_r)/(W_r) double induction.

**Theorem 3.1: (L_r) implies (W_{r+1})** (`R27.3/theorem-3-1-killing-ramification`). For r ≥ 1, (L_r) implies (W_{r+1}). Let ρ̄ be of S-type, good-dihedral for q, with k(ρ̄) = 2 and N(ρ̄) odd with at most r + 1 prime divisors. If N(ρ̄) has at most r prime divisors, (L_r) applies directly. Otherwise choose a prime s ≠ q dividing N(ρ̄); the good-dihedral prime is never killed. Theorem 5.1(1) gives an almost strictly compatible lift (ρ_ι), minimally ramified away from p and crystalline of weight 2 at p. The mod-s member ρ̄_s is of S-type and q-dihedral (Lemma 6.3(ii)), and the primes dividing N(ρ̄_s) are among those of the prime-to-s part of N(ρ̄): the ramification at s is absorbed into the coefficient prime. So (L_r) makes ρ̄_s modular, and Theorem 4.1 at s makes (ρ_ι), hence ρ̄, modular. Theorem 4.1 needs non-solvable image of ρ̄_s if s = 2, and absolute irreducibility over ℚ(μ_s) if s > 2; both follow from q-dihedrality.

**Theorem 3.3: the initial case (W₁)** (`R27.3/theorem-3-3-initial-case`). (W₁) holds: every ρ̄ of S-type, good-dihedral for q, with k(ρ̄) = 2 and N(ρ̄) odd with at most one prime divisor, is modular. Indeed q | N(ρ̄) since ρ̄|_{I_q} ≅ ψ ⊕ ψ^q with ψ ≠ 1, so q is the only prime divisor; ψ ⊕ ψ^q has no inertia invariants, so N(ρ̄) = q². Thus ρ̄ is unramified outside {p, q}, tamely ramified at q, and |ρ̄(I_q)| = ord ψ is a power of the odd prime t > 5. Corollary 8.1(ii) applies; p = 2 is allowed, and t > p excludes its branch t = p.

**The double induction** (`R27.3/double-induction-assembly`). (L_r) holds for every r ≥ 1: (W₁) and Theorem 3.2 give (L₁); then (L_r) ⇒ (W_{r+1}) by Theorem 3.1 ⇒ (L_{r+1}) by Theorem 3.2. The two parameters of the double induction are the number of primes dividing N(ρ̄) (this target) and the residue characteristic (inside Theorem 3.2). The conductor does not decrease at every congruence: inside Theorem 3.2 the auxiliary representations can have r + 1 prime divisors. Theorem 1.2 is derived in R27.4 and is not used here.

### Layer R27.4: Removing the good-dihedral condition

*Milestones:* raising levels; weight and level from minimal lifts; Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 1.2.

**The auxiliary characteristic** (`R27.4/auxiliary-characteristic-choice`). Let ρ̄ be of S-type with ρ̄|_{ℚ(μ_p)} absolutely irreducible (non-solvable image if p = 2), and (ρ_λ) an E-rational almost strictly compatible **weight-two** lift, from Theorem 5.1(2), of ρ̄ (twisted into weight 2 ≤ k ≤ p + 1 if p is odd); S is the set of primes other than p at which ρ̄ ramifies, and the system is ramified only at S ∪ {p} and at the coefficient primes. The system's weight is two even when k(ρ̄) > 2. Then either ρ̄ is modular, or there is a prime p′ > 5, p′ ≡ 1 (mod 4), larger than every prime of S ∪ {p} and split completely in E, such that ρ̄_{p′} : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽_{p′}) is absolutely irreducible of weight 2 with non-solvable image. For p′ ∉ S ∪ {p, 2}, almost strict compatibility gives k(ρ̄_{p′}) = 2, that is ρ̄_{p′}|_{I_{p′}} is (ω_{p′}, ∗; 0, 1) or ω_{p′,2} ⊕ ω_{p′,2}^{p′}. It is not induced from the quadratic subfield of ℚ(μ_{p′}), since Lemma 6.2(ii) would force weight (p′ + 1)/2 or (p′ + 3)/2. The projective image of inertia contains an element of order p′ − 1 or p′ + 1, at least 6, so by Dickson a solvable projective image is dihedral; then Lemma 6.2(i) and a lifting theorem for weight-two lifts with dihedral residual image (Diamond's in the source, covered by `GL2ModularityLifting:R22.5/kisin-potentially-bt-lifting`) make ρ̄ modular. The conditions on p′ are Chebotarev conditions in E(i), so infinitely many p′ qualify. Only the absolutely irreducible residual members, almost all of them, are considered.

**Theorem 3.4: raising levels** (`R27.4/theorem-3-4-raising-levels-and-the-chebotarev-choice`). Assume (D_r) for some r ≥ 0. Then every ρ̄ of S-type of characteristic p with 2^{r+1} ∤ N(ρ̄), and with k(ρ̄) = 2 when p = 2 and r = 0, is modular.
Proof outline: reduce to ρ̄|_{ℚ(μ_p)} absolutely irreducible (Lemma 6.2) and to non-solvable image when p = 2 (Lemma 6.1). Twisting by a power of χ̄_p, which changes neither modularity nor N(ρ̄), we may assume 2 ≤ k(ρ̄) ≤ p + 1 for odd p. Lift by Theorem 5.1(2) to an E-rational almost strictly compatible system (ρ_λ) and choose p′ as above. Take q from Lemma 8.2 for ρ̄_{p′} and insert it with Theorem 5.1(4), obtaining (ρ′_λ) linked to (ρ_λ) at ρ̄_{p′}. Let s be the largest prime below p′: s > 2, ρ̄′_s is good-dihedral for q, and 2^{r+1} ∤ N(ρ̄′_s), so (D_r) makes ρ̄′_s modular. Theorem 4.1 at s makes (ρ′_λ) modular, and Theorem 4.1 at p′, where ρ̄_{p′} has non-solvable image, makes (ρ_λ) and ρ̄ modular.
The dyadic conductor is propagated as a chain of bounds. Let A be the conductor exponent at 2 of the Weil–Deligne parameter of (ρ_λ). For p odd, ρ_p is minimal at 2 and A = v₂(N(ρ̄)) ≤ r. For p = 2, k(ρ̄) = 2, the parameter at 2 is (1 ⊕ 1, 0) and A = 0. For p = 2, k(ρ̄) = 4, the lift is Steinberg at 2, the parameter is (id, N) with N ≠ 0, and A = 0 + dim V^{I₂} − dim ker N = 1, while v₂(N(ρ̄)) = 0; the theorem excludes r = 0 here, so A ≤ r. Reduction at p′ ≠ 2 does not increase the conductor, so v₂(N(ρ̄_{p′})) ≤ A; the minimal lift from Theorem 5.1(4) has dyadic exponent v₂(N(ρ̄_{p′})); and reduction at s ≠ 2 gives v₂(N(ρ̄′_s)) ≤ A ≤ r. No equality with v₂(N(ρ̄)) is claimed.

**From modularity to weight k(ρ̄) and level N(ρ̄)** (`R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts`). Let ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽) be of S-type and modular, with p odd, or p = 2 and k(ρ̄) = 2. Then ρ̄ arises from S_{k(ρ̄)}(Γ₁(N(ρ̄))).
- If the projective image is dihedral, Lemma 6.2(i) gives the conclusion. This covers ρ̄|_{G_{ℚ(μ_p)}} reducible for odd p, every solvable image at p = 2, and every ρ̄ induced from ℚ(i); the last are kept apart from Buzzard's theorem, which excludes them.
- Otherwise choose i with 2 ≤ k(ρ̄ ⊗ χ_p^i) ≤ p + 1 (i = 0 when p = 2) and put ρ̄′ = ρ̄ ⊗ χ_p^i, with N(ρ̄′) = N(ρ̄). Theorem 5.1(1) gives a lift of ρ̄′, minimal at every prime ≠ p and crystalline of weight k(ρ̄′) at p; Theorem 4.1 makes it modular, and its newform has weight k(ρ̄′), level prime to p, and level N(ρ̄) away from p. Undo the twist: twisting by χ_p is the θ-operator on mod-p forms of level prime to p, Edixhoven's weight theorem (no exceptional case for p > 2) gives a mod-p eigenform of type (N(ρ̄), k(ρ̄), ε), and as k(ρ̄) ≥ 2 the Deligne–Serre lemma lifts it to characteristic zero. The resulting newform has level dividing N(ρ̄) and divisible by N(ρ̄), since the prime-to-p conductor of ρ̄ divides that of every lift.
The twist is needed because Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 assume 2 ≤ k ≤ p + 1 while Serre's weight goes up to p² − 1: for p ≥ 5, ρ̄|_{I_p} ≅ χ̄_p ⊕ χ̄_p² has weight p + 3 and its twist by χ̄_p^{−1} has weight 2. The case p = 2, k(ρ̄) = 4 is excluded: Theorem 5.1(1) has no crystalline branch there. At p = 2 the theorem covers ρ̄|_{D₂} scalar with non-dihedral projective image, where Buzzard's multiplicity-one level lowering is not available; a scalar ρ̄|_{D₂} is unramified up to twist, hence finite, so k(ρ̄) = 2 automatically. Khare–Wintenberger state this refinement in Theorem 1.2 but write out only the modularity; this target supplies the passage (§7).

**Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 1.2** (`R27.4/theorem-1-2`). (1) For p odd, every ρ̄ of S-type with N(ρ̄) odd arises from S_{k(ρ̄)}(Γ₁(N(ρ̄))). (2) For p = 2, every ρ̄ of S-type with k(ρ̄) = 2 arises from S₂(Γ₁(N(ρ̄))). Proof: (D₀) holds; Theorem 3.4 with r = 0 makes ρ̄ modular; the previous target gives the weight and level. At p = 2 the theorem does not give Edixhoven's strong form (unramified at 2 if and only if arising from a Katz form of weight one). Weight 4 at p = 2 and even conductor in odd characteristic are Theorem 9.1.

### Layer R27.5: Characteristic two, weight four and even conductor

*Milestone:* Theorem 9.1, the reduction to Hypothesis (H).

Hypothesis (H) of Khare–Wintenberger §9 says: a continuous, odd, irreducible p-adic representation ρ, unramified outside a finite set, of weight two and potentially crystalline at p, whose residual representation is modular with non-solvable image, is modular. At p = 2 it is Kisin's theorem, through the passage from potentially crystalline of weight two to potentially Barsotti–Tate. It is `GL2ModularityLifting:R22.6/hypothesis-h`, with these hypotheses unchanged; this layer uses it only at p = 2.

**The dyadic weight claim** (`R27.5/dyadic-weight-two-claim`). In the proof of (D₁) below, k(ρ̄′₂) = 2. Otherwise ρ̄′₂|_{D₂} is très ramifiée, and a très ramifiée representation becomes finite flat over no finite extension K/ℚ₂ of odd ramification index: its Kummer class has odd valuation, which stays odd. But over K = ℚ₄(χ′), of ramification index 3 (the order of χ′), ρ′₂ is crystalline with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1}, because its Weil–Deligne parameter (τ, 0) becomes unramified there; so it comes from a 2-divisible group and ρ̄′₂|_{G_K} is finite flat, a contradiction. The local type at 2 comes from Theorem 5.1(4) and almost strict compatibility at 2, which applies because ρ̄′₂ is irreducible. Savitt's computation of residual weights does not cover p = 2, which is why this separate argument is needed.

**(D₁) through a congruence at 3** (`R27.5/d1-by-the-prime-three`). (D₁) holds: every good-dihedral ρ̄ of S-type in odd characteristic p with 4 ∤ N(ρ̄) is modular. After a twist by a power of χ̄_p, which keeps good-dihedrality and N(ρ̄), lift ρ̄ by Theorem 5.1(2) to an almost strictly compatible system with ρ_p a minimal weight-two lift. ρ̄₃ is good-dihedral (2, 3 ≤ max(Q(N(ρ̄)/q²), p)), so has non-solvable image. If ρ̄₃ is unramified at 2, its conductor is odd and Theorem 1.2(1) at 3 with Theorem 4.1 concludes. Otherwise ρ̄₃(I₂) is unipotent and ρ̄₃|_{D₂} is an unramified twist of (χ̄₃, ∗; 0, 1). Theorem 5.1(4), applied to ρ̄₃ at q = 2 with the order-3 characters χ′, χ′² of I₂ (niveau two, since 3 | 2 + 1), gives a system (ρ′_λ) lifting ρ̄₃ with ρ′₃|_{I₂} ≅ (χ′, ∗; 0, χ′²) and Weil–Deligne parameter (τ, 0) at 2, τ irreducible. Then ρ̄′₂ has non-solvable image, weight 2 by the previous target, and is modular by Theorem 1.2(2); ρ′₂ is potentially crystalline of weight two at 2, so (H) makes it and (ρ′_λ) modular; Theorem 4.1 at 3 transfers modularity to (ρ_λ) and ρ̄. With Theorem 3.4 for r = 1, (D₁) gives modularity of every S-type representation of characteristic 2. This is the mod-3 step of Theorem 3.2 with 2 and 3 exchanged.

**(D_r) for r ≥ 2** (`R27.5/dr-for-r-at-least-two`). For every r ≥ 2, (D_r) holds. If ρ̄(I₂) is unipotent up to twist, a twist by a character unramified outside 2, which preserves good-dihedrality and the odd part of the conductor, has 4 ∤ N and is modular by (D₁). Otherwise, after a twist by a power of χ̄_p, which keeps good-dihedrality and N(ρ̄), lift ρ̄ by Theorem 5.1(2); ρ̄₂ is good-dihedral, so of non-solvable image, and modular, since every S-type representation of characteristic 2 is (by (D₁) and Theorem 3.4); ρ₂ is potentially crystalline of weight two at 2, since a minimal lift of a ρ̄|_{I₂} that is not unipotent up to twist has finite inertia image (minimality gives ρ_p(I₂) ≅ ρ̄(I₂) unless ρ̄(I₂) is projectively cyclic of order p). (H), applied with non-solvable residual image, makes ρ₂, (ρ_λ) and ρ̄ modular.

### Layer R27.6: The strong theorem and its exports

*Milestones:* Serre's modularity conjecture (strong form); odd Artin representations and weight-one modularity; Khare's weight-one descent.

**Serre's modularity conjecture, strong form** (`R27.6/full-classical-serre-theorem`). Let ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) be continuous, odd and absolutely irreducible. There are a normalised newform f of weight k(ρ̄) ≥ 2, level N(ρ̄) and character ε, a prime λ | p of its coefficient field relative to ι_p, and an isomorphism of the reduction of ρ_{f,λ} with ρ̄; moreover det ρ̄ = ε̄ χ̄_p^{k(ρ̄)−1}, so ε reduces to ε(ρ̄). The cases:
- p odd and N(ρ̄) odd: Theorem 1.2(1);
- p odd and N(ρ̄) even: Theorem 9.1, then `R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts`;
- p = 2 and k(ρ̄) = 2: Theorem 1.2(2);
- p = 2 and k(ρ̄) = 4: Theorem 9.1, then the dyadic optimisation: Buzzard's level lowering for ρ̄ not induced from ℚ(i), Lemma 6.2(i) for dihedral ρ̄, and the passage from weight 2 at level 2N(ρ̄), Steinberg at 2, to weight 4 at level N(ρ̄).
The determinant identity and the invariance under enlarging the coefficient field are those of `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6` and `R15.4`. Only classical forms of weight at least 2 are produced. Khare's level-one theorem enters only through Corollary 8.1, as the base of the induction.

**The finite-flat weight-two export** (`R27.6/finite-flat-weight-two-export`). Let p ≥ 5 and ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) odd and absolutely irreducible, finite at p (ρ̄|_{D_p} extends to a finite flat group scheme over ℤ_p), with det ρ̄ = χ̄_p. Then there are a normalised newform g of weight 2, level N(ρ̄) and trivial character, and a prime λ | p of its coefficient field, with ρ̄_{g,λ} ≅ ρ̄; in particular a_ℓ(g) ≡ tr ρ̄(Frob_ℓ) (mod λ) for ℓ ∤ pN(ρ̄). By Serre's Proposition 4, finiteness at p with det ρ̄|_{I_p} = χ̄_p gives k(ρ̄) = 2; det ρ̄ = χ̄_p gives ε(ρ̄) = 1; the strong form gives a newform of weight 2 and level N(ρ̄) with character reducing to 1; Carayol's change of nebentypus (p ≥ 5) makes the character trivial at the same weight and level. The level is the prime-to-p conductor of ρ̄, not the conductor of an elliptic curve; `EllipticCurveModularity:R29.2` compares them.

**Theorem 10.1(i): regular compatible systems** (`R27.6/scope-of-the-final-statement-and-the-compatible-system-export`). Every odd, irreducible, regular compatible system of two-dimensional representations of G_ℚ comes, after a twist, from a newform of weight at least 2. First, ρ̄_λ is irreducible for almost all λ, by the bounded conductor and fixed Hodge–Tate weights. Twist so that the Hodge–Tate numbers are (a, 0) with a ≥ 0; regularity gives a > 0. Apply the strong form to ρ̄_λ for infinitely many λ: the forms all lie in S_k(Γ₁(N)) with k = a + 1 and N fixed, so one newform occurs infinitely often. Part (ii) of Theorem 10.1, for irregular systems, is stated in general by `ModularityAndLanglandsExtensions:ML.1`, which imports from this layer the strong form, the weight-one step and Khare's descent, and adds Sen–Fontaine unramifiedness and the irreducibility of almost all ρ̄_λ. Its finite-image case is Corollary 10.2(ii) below.

**Reductions of an odd Artin representation** (`R27.6/artin-reductions-of-serre-type`). Let ρ : G_ℚ → GL₂(ℂ) be continuous, irreducible and odd, with image G = Gal(M/ℚ) (finite, since GL₂(ℂ) has no small subgroups), Artin conductor N and determinant ε, a Dirichlet character mod N with ε(−1) = −1.
(a) There are a number field E ⊂ ℂ and ρ_E : G → GL₂(E) with ρ_E ⊗ ℂ ≅ ρ. For every finite place λ of E, with residue characteristic ℓ, ρ_E stabilises an 𝒪_λ-lattice Λ, and ρ̄_λ = Λ/λΛ satisfies tr ρ̄_λ(Frob_r) ≡ tr ρ(Frob_r) and det ρ̄_λ(Frob_r) ≡ ε(r) (mod λ) for primes r ∤ Nℓ. E need not be the field of traces.
(b) If ℓ ∤ |G|, then ℓ is odd, ρ̄_λ is absolutely irreducible, odd, faithful on G, independent of Λ, and dim (ρ̄_λ)^H = dim ρ^H for every subgroup H ≤ G.
(c) If moreover ℓ ∤ N, then ρ̄_λ is unramified at ℓ, N(ρ̄_λ) = N, ε(ρ̄_λ) = ε mod λ, Serre's weight is k(ρ̄_λ) = ℓ and Edixhoven's weight is 1.
(d) The primes ℓ ∤ N|G| with ρ(Frob_ℓ) conjugate to ρ(c) have Dirichlet density |C|/|G| > 0, C the class of ρ(c); for such ℓ, ρ̄_λ(Frob_ℓ) has the distinct eigenvalues 1 and −1, so ρ̄_λ|_{D_ℓ} ≅ 1 ⊕ η with η ≠ 1 unramified.
Proof outline: ℚ̄[G] is split semisimple, so ρ is realisable over a number field; the lattice Σ_g ρ_E(g)𝒪_λ² is stable. When ℓ ∤ |G| the averaging idempotent e_H = |H|⁻¹Σ_{h∈H} h acts on Λ, so invariants commute with reduction; the endomorphism ring of the reduction is the reduction of a rank-one direct summand, and Maschke's theorem gives semisimplicity, so the reduction is absolutely irreducible. The kernel of GL₂(𝒪_λ) → GL₂(k_λ) is pro-ℓ, which gives faithfulness. The conductor is computed from the ramification filtration of M, the same for ρ and ρ̄_λ, and the invariant dimensions agree. Trivial inertia at ℓ gives Serre weight ℓ and Edixhoven weight 1, and det ρ̄_λ = ε(ρ̄_λ)χ̄_ℓ^{ℓ−1} = ε(ρ̄_λ). Chebotarev gives (d).

**Weight one modulo ℓ** (`R27.6/unramified-residual-representations-arise-in-weight-one`). Let ℓ be an odd prime and ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_ℓ) continuous, irreducible, odd and unramified at ℓ, with conductor N and character ε = det ρ̄, such that ρ̄(Frob_ℓ) has two distinct eigenvalues. Then there is a Katz cuspidal eigenform h of type (N, 1, ε) over 𝔽̄_ℓ (a section of ω ⊗ 𝒪(−cusps) on the Γ₁(N) moduli stack, on which the diamond operators act through ε) with T_r h = tr ρ̄(Frob_r) · h for every prime r ∤ Nℓ. The form need not lift to characteristic zero for this ℓ.
Proof outline: k(ρ̄) = ℓ, so the strong form gives a newform f of weight ℓ and level N with ρ̄_{f,λ′} ≅ ρ̄; its reduction g is a Katz eigenform of type (N, ℓ, ε). g is ordinary, since a supersingular eigenform has ramified local representation at ℓ. So ρ_g|_{D_ℓ} ≅ (λ(ε(ℓ)/a_ℓ), ∗; 0, λ(a_ℓ)), and distinct Frobenius eigenvalues give a_ℓ² ≠ ε(ℓ). ρ̄ is not exceptional in Edixhoven's sense, Edixhoven's weight is 1, and Gross's companion-form theorem (k = ℓ, k′ = 1) gives h with a_r(h) = a_r(g) for r ≠ ℓ. Without the hypothesis on Frob_ℓ the conclusion still holds for ℓ > 2 by the form of Edixhoven's theorem without an exceptional case (Coleman–Voloch); the Artin case below uses only the form with the hypothesis.

**Weight-one forms reduce onto Katz forms for almost all ℓ** (`R27.6/weight-one-reduction-is-onto-for-almost-all-primes`). Let N ≥ 5, X = X₁(N) over ℤ[1/N] (proper smooth of relative dimension one), ω its Hodge bundle, C the cusps, and S₁(N; A) = H⁰(X_A, ω ⊗ 𝒪(−C)) for a ℤ[1/N]-algebra A. There is a finite set B(N) of primes such that for every prime ℓ ∤ N outside B(N) and every discrete valuation ring 𝒪 flat over ℤ_(ℓ) with residue field k, the base-change map S₁(N; 𝒪) ⊗ k → S₁(N; k) is an isomorphism, compatible with T_r (r ∤ Nℓ) and the diamond operators. One may take B(N) to be the primes ℓ for which H¹(X, ω ⊗ 𝒪(−C)) has nonzero ℓ-torsion: multiplication by ℓ on the invertible sheaf gives 0 → H⁰/ℓ → H⁰(X_{𝔽_ℓ}, ·) → H¹[ℓ] → 0, and H¹ is finitely generated over the principal ideal domain ℤ[1/N], so only finitely many primes divide its torsion. B(N) may be nonempty. In weight k ≥ 2 the exceptional set is empty (H¹ vanishes for k ≥ 3, and is locally free for k = 2 by Kodaira–Spencer and duality).

**Khare's weight-one descent** (`R27.6/weight-one-descent-from-infinitely-many-primes`). Let N ≥ 1, ε a Dirichlet character mod N, E ⊂ ℂ a number field containing its values, and (t_r) elements of 𝒪_E indexed by the primes r ∤ N. Put N′ = N if N ≥ 5 and N′ = 5N otherwise. Suppose that for infinitely many primes ℓ there are a place λ | ℓ of E, an embedding of its residue field in 𝔽̄_ℓ, and a Katz cuspidal eigenform h_ℓ of type (N, 1, ε mod λ) over 𝔽̄_ℓ with T_r h_ℓ = (t_r mod λ) h_ℓ for every prime r ∤ Nℓ. Then there is a normalised newform f of weight one and level dividing N′, with character agreeing with ε on integers prime to N′, such that a_r(f) = t_r for every prime r ∤ N′. If moreover ρ : G_ℚ → GL₂(ℂ) is continuous, semisimple and unramified outside N with tr ρ(Frob_r) = t_r and det ρ(Frob_r) = ε(r) for r ∤ N, then ρ is isomorphic to the Deligne–Serre representation ρ_f. Nothing is assumed about T_ℓ or the operators at primes dividing N, and the level of f is only shown to divide N′.
Proof outline: pull h_ℓ back to level N′ and discard ℓ | 2N′ and ℓ ∈ B(N′). By the previous target, h_ℓ lies in the reduction of the finite free module M = S₁(N′; ℤ[1/N′]); the Deligne–Serre lemma gives an eigenvector over a discrete valuation ring with eigenvalues b_r ≡ t_r. The eigenvalue systems on M ⊗ ℚ̄ form a finite Galois-stable set, so one system Θ occurs for infinitely many ℓ; then Θ(T_r) − t_r lies in primes above infinitely many rational primes and vanishes. Θ is the system of a nonzero weight-one form, and the theory of newforms gives f. Two semisimple representations of finite image with equal traces and determinants at all Frobenius elements outside a finite set are isomorphic, by Chebotarev.

**Odd Artin representations come from weight one** (`R27.6/odd-artin-weight-one-modularity`).

There is a normalised cuspidal newform f of weight one, level dividing N′ and character det ρ on integers prime to N′, with ρ ≅ ρ_f. This is Khare–Wintenberger Corollary 10.2(ii). Proof: for ℓ in the positive-density set P_c of `R27.6/artin-reductions-of-serre-type`(d) and λ | ℓ, ρ̄_λ is absolutely irreducible, odd, unramified at ℓ with distinct Frobenius eigenvalues 1, −1, of conductor N and character det ρ mod λ; the weight-one step gives a Katz eigenform h_ℓ of type (N, 1, det ρ mod λ) with eigenvalues tr ρ(Frob_r) mod λ; descent over the infinite set P_c gives f. The weight-one step used is the non-exceptional case of Edixhoven's theorem.

### Layer R33.1: The qualitative target and the first weight change

*Milestones:* Serre's conjecture, weak form; Paso 1, the change to a weight-two system.

The modern route proves modularity of every odd irreducible ρ̄ without weight reduction and without the (L_r)/(W_r) induction. Its inputs are lift existence (Dieulefait–Pacetti Theorem 1.9, whose cases (1)–(3) are Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 5.1), almost strictly compatible systems (Theorem 1.11, Dieulefait), the de Rham lifting theorems 1.4–1.7, Langlands–Tunnell and Rohrlich–Tunnell, and the base cases of Tate, Serre and Schoof. From the classical strand it uses only the definition of good-dihedral primes, Lemma 6.3 and Lemma 8.2.

**The weak form and the solvable case** (`R33.1/dp-target-and-the-weight-at-least-two-convention`). Target: every odd continuous irreducible ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) is modular, ρ̄ ≅ ρ̄_{f,p} for an eigenform f ∈ S_k(Γ₀(N), ε). Only forms of weight k ≥ 2 are used: a representation congruent to that of a weight-one form is congruent to one of weight at least 2 (Deligne–Serre, §6.9). For p odd, solvable image is Theorem 1.3 (Langlands–Tunnell): by Dickson the projective image is cyclic, dihedral, A₄ or S₄, ρ̄ lifts to an odd complex representation, and that comes from a weight-one form. So in odd characteristic the target reduces to non-solvable image. At p = 2 the solvable case is Rohrlich–Tunnell (R33.5). Dieulefait–Pacetti take the passage from the weak to the strong form from the literature (Edixhoven for the weight; Ribet and Boston–Lenstra–Ribet for the level), which leaves the scalar dyadic case open; this roadmap obtains the passage in R33.6, from `R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts` and the dyadic optimisation.

**Modularity transfer along congruences** (`R33.1/dp-modularity-lifting-inputs`). Let ρ, ρ′ : G_ℚ → GL₂(ℚ̄_p) be continuous, odd, finitely ramified and de Rham at p with Hodge–Tate weights {0, k − 1} and {0, k′ − 1}, k, k′ > 1, with isomorphic residual representations. If p is odd and ρ̄|_{G_{ℚ(√p*)}} is absolutely irreducible (Theorem 1.4), or p = 2 and ρ̄ has non-solvable image (Theorem 1.5), then ρ is modular if and only if ρ′ is. Theorem 1.4 is Kisin's, with the local–global hypothesis removed by Emerton or Paškūnas and the remaining one by Hu–Tan (p ≥ 5) and Tung (p = 3); Theorem 1.5 is due to Kisin, Paškūnas and Tung. For residually reducible ρ̄: Theorem 1.6 (p ≥ 5, ρ irreducible and de Rham with Hodge–Tate weights {0, k − 1}: ρ is modular; Skinner–Wiles and Pan), and Theorem 1.7 (p = 3, ρ̄^{ss} ≅ 1 ⊕ χ̄₃, ρ|_{I₃} of the form (∗, ∗; 0, 1), det ρ = ψχ₃^{k−1} with ψ of finite order: Skinner–Wiles). With Remark 4, that a compatible system is modular if one member is, these propagate modularity along every chain of systems below. The residual condition of Theorem 1.4 over ℚ(√p*) is equivalent to absolute irreducibility over ℚ(ζ_p) (Dieulefait–Pacetti Lemma 1.13). Each application below verifies the contract of `GL2ModularityLifting:R32.2/application-requirements`: the residual image, the Hodge–Tate weights, oddness, residual modularity or the congruence. No ordinarity is required.
Theorem 1.7 is printed with a further condition, that ρ|_{D₃} is not the identity. In Skinner–Wiles' theorem, as stated in `GL2ModularityLifting:R32.5/p-three-residually-reducible-branch`, the condition is χ̄|_{D₃} ≠ 1 for the nontrivial residual character χ̄ = χ̄₃; it holds automatically, since χ̄₃ is ramified at 3.

**Fontaine–Laffaille members are not bad dihedral** (`R33.1/fontaine-laffaille-member-not-bad-dihedral`). Let p be odd and ρ : G_ℚ → GL₂(ℚ̄_p) crystalline at p with Hodge–Tate weights {0, k − 1}, k ≥ 2, and p > 2k. Then k(ρ̄) = k, and if ρ̄ is irreducible it is not bad dihedral. Indeed a bad-dihedral ρ̄ has p = 2k(ρ̄) − 1 (niveau one) or p = 2k(ρ̄) − 3 (niveau two) by Lemma 1.14, the statement of Khare–Wintenberger Lemma 6.2(ii): the projective image of I_p has order at most 2; in niveau one χ^{k−1} has order ≤ 2 with k ≤ p, so 2k − 2 = p − 1 or k = p, and k = p makes the image of I_p trivial, which a bad-dihedral ρ̄ excludes; in niveau two ψ^{(k−1)(p−1)} has order (p + 1)/gcd(p + 1, k − 1), at most 2 only for k − 1 = (p + 1)/2. The uses are (k, w) with w > 2k in Paso 1, (2, q) with q > 5 in Paso 2, and (2, p) with p > 3 in characteristic two.

**Solvable residual image ends the argument** (`R33.1/solvable-residual-termination`). Let p ≥ 5 and ρ : G_ℚ → GL₂(ℚ̄_p) odd, irreducible, finitely ramified and de Rham at p with Hodge–Tate weights {0, k − 1}, k > 1, with ρ̄ of solvable image and not bad dihedral. Then ρ is modular: if ρ̄ is reducible by Theorem 1.6, if irreducible by Theorem 1.3 and then Theorem 1.4. This ends Paso 1 at w, Paso 2 at q and the reduction of characteristic two; w > 2k ≥ 4 and q > 5 provide p ≥ 5, and the previous target provides "not bad dihedral". ρ is irreducible as a member of an irreducible system.

**Paso 1: change to a weight-two system** (`R33.1/paso-1-weight-two-system`). Let p be odd and ρ̄ odd irreducible with non-solvable image, twisted so that 2 ≤ k = k(ρ̄) ≤ p + 1. Let ρ^{(0)} be a minimal crystalline lift (Theorem 1.9(3)) in an almost strictly compatible system (Theorem 1.11); non-solvable image gives the absolute irreducibility over ℚ(ζ_p) that both theorems need. Choose a prime w > 2k outside its ramification set. Then either ρ^{(0)}_w, and so ρ̄, is modular, or ρ̄^{(0)}_w has non-solvable image and there is an almost strictly compatible system {ρ^{(1)}_ℓ} with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1}, containing a weight-two lift of ρ̄^{(0)}_w with the same ramification set (Theorem 1.9(4)), such that ρ̄ is modular if and only if {ρ^{(1)}_ℓ} is. Write S₁ for its ramification set; w may lie in S₁, since the new lift need not be crystalline at w.

### Layer R33.2: The good-dihedral prime and the odd level

*Milestones:* Paso 2, the good-dihedral prime N; Paso 3, killing the odd part of the level.

**The dihedral local type at N** (`R33.2/dihedral-local-type-at-n`). Let q be an odd prime and N a prime with q | N + 1 (so q ∤ N − 1). The unit group of 𝔽_{N²} has order N² − 1 = (N − 1)(N + 1), so by local class field theory there is a character κ : G_{ℚ_{N²}} → ℤ̄_q^× of order q whose restriction to I_N factors through 𝔽_{N²}^× and not through 𝔽_N^× (niveau two), normalised by κ(Art(N)) = 1. Its induction τ_N = Ind_{G_{ℚ_{N²}}}^{G_{ℚ_N}} κ is irreducible (κ ≠ κ^N as q ∤ N − 1), τ_N|_{I_N} ≅ κ ⊕ κ^N, and its image is dihedral of order 2q. Without the normalisation, κ(Art(N)) = ζ ≠ 1 is a scalar in the image, which then has order 2q²; the projective image is dihedral of order 2q in either case, and the inertial type depends only on κ|_{I_N}.
The *standard lattice* is L_std = Ind 𝒪(κ) over the integers 𝒪 of a finite extension of ℚ_q containing μ_q, with basis e₁ = 1 ⊗ 1, e₂ = s ⊗ 1 for a Frobenius lift s. A tame generator σ acts by diag(κ(σ), κ(σ)^N) and s by (0, 1; 1, 0): the transfer sends s to s² = Art(Nu) with u a unit, and κ is trivial on units of ℤ_N because q ∤ N − 1, so κ(s²) = κ(Art(N)) = 1. Since 𝔽̄_q^× has no element of order q, κ̄ = 1, and L_std modulo the maximal ideal is 1 ⊕ η with η the unramified quadratic character: unramified, with trace 0 at Frob_N. This residual statement is about L_std only. Every stable lattice has semisimplified reduction 1 ⊕ η, but another stable lattice can reduce to a non-split extension with nontrivial unipotent inertia, as the lattice L₁ of R33.3 does at (q, N) = (3, 2). With coefficients in ℤ̄_p for p ≠ q the reduction stays irreducible.

API of the full local construction, which needs the local Galois groups and characters of `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`:
- `levelTwoCharacter` — κ : G_{ℚ_{N²}} → 𝒪^× of order q for q | N + 1, with κ(Art(N)) = 1; `levelTwoCharacter_orderOf`: its order is q and κ|_{I_N} does not factor through 𝔽_N^×; `levelTwoCharacter_artin`: κ(Art(N)) = 1.
- `dihedralType` — τ_N = Ind κ : G_{ℚ_N} → GL₂(𝒪) in the basis e₁, e₂ of L_std; `dihedralType_irreducible`: τ_N is irreducible, and so is its reduction modulo any prime p ≠ q.
- `dihedralType.standardLattice` — L_std = 𝒪e₁ ⊕ 𝒪e₂, with σ ↦ diag(κ(σ), κ(σ)^N) and s ↦ (0, 1; 1, 0).
- `dihedralType_standardLattice_residual` — L_std/𝔪L_std ≅ 1 ⊕ η, unramified with trace 0 at Frob_N.
- `dihedralType_residual_semisimplification` — for every stable lattice Λ, (Λ/𝔪Λ)^{ss} ≅ 1 ⊕ η; Λ/𝔪Λ itself depends on Λ.

Tests:
- `residue_field_units`: 5² − 1 = 24 = 4 · 6 while |𝔽₂₅| = 25, so (N − 1)(N + 1) is the order of the unit group.
- `level_two_q7_N13`: q = 7, N = 13: 7 | 14 and 7 ∤ 12, so κ has niveau two.
- `level_one_nonexample`: q = 3, N = 7: 3 | 6 = N − 1, so a character of order 3 of I_N factors through 𝔽₇^×, κ^N = κ on I_N, and with κ(Art(N)) = 1 the induction Ind κ is reducible.
- `residual_trace_zero`: on L_std, κ̄ = 1 and the trace of Frob_N on 1 ⊕ η is 1 − 1 = 0.
- `unnormalised_character`: if κ(Art(N)) = ζ ≠ 1, the restriction of Ind κ to G_{ℚ_{N²}} maps onto μ_q × μ_q and Ind κ has image of order 2q², with projective image still dihedral of order 2q.
- `residual_depends_on_lattice`: at (q, N) = (3, 2), 𝒪 = ℤ₃[ζ], π = ζ − 1, the stable lattice L₁ = 𝒪(e₁ + e₂) + 𝒪πe₂ reduces to σ ↦ (1, 0; 1, 1), with one-dimensional inertia invariants, while L_std reduces to trivial inertia; a residual statement that names no lattice is false.

**Paso 2: inserting the good-dihedral prime N** (`R33.2/dp-lift-existence-and-good-dihedral-insertion`). Let {ρ^{(1)}_ℓ} be the weight-two system of Paso 1, with coefficient field K and ramification set S₁. Choose a prime q ≡ 1 (mod 4), q > 5, larger than every prime of S₁ and split in K. As q ∉ S₁ the residual weight at q is 2, not q + 1. Either ρ^{(1)}_q is modular (solvable residual image; not bad dihedral since k = 2 and q > 5), or ρ̄^{(1)}_q : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽_q), 𝔽_q-valued because q splits in K, has non-solvable image; non-solvable image gives the absolute irreducibility over ℚ(ζ_q) that Theorems 1.9 and 1.11 need. Choose N ∉ S₁ by Lemma 8.2 (Dieulefait–Pacetti Lemma 1.15): tr ρ̄^{(1)}_q(Frob_N) = 0 and χ̄_q(Frob_N) = −1, so ρ̄^{(1)}_q|_{D_N} is, up to twist, diag(χ̄_q, 1), and q | N + 1. Theorem 1.9(4), in its crystalline-at-q alternative with the compatible type τ_N at N, gives a lift ρ^{(2)}_q, crystalline of weight 2 at q, whose inertial type at N is that of τ_N: ρ^{(2)}_q(I_N) is cyclic of order q, acting through κ ⊕ κ^N, and the projective image of D_N is dihedral of order 2q. The image of D_N itself is infinite, since det ρ^{(2)}_q(Frob_N) = ψ(N)N is not a root of unity. By Theorem 1.4, ρ^{(1)}_q is modular if and only if ρ^{(2)}_q is, and Theorem 1.11 places ρ^{(2)}_q in a system {ρ^{(2)}_ℓ} with ramification set S = S₁ ∪ {N}. N ≡ 1 (mod 8) and N ≡ 1 modulo every prime ≤ q − 1 (Lemma 8.2(ii)) are what Lemma 2.1 needs. This target is the Paso 2 application only; the general existence theorem, Theorem 1.9(1)–(4), is `PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.3`.

API of the bundled insertion datum, which needs the compatible systems of `PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.6`:
- `GoodDihedralInsertion` — the data (q, N, κ, {ρ^{(2)}_ℓ}) with q ≡ 1 (mod 4), q > 5, q > max S₁, q split in K, and N as in Lemma 8.2 for ρ̄^{(1)}_q.
- `GoodDihedralInsertion.system` — the system {ρ^{(2)}_ℓ}, ramified exactly at S₁ ∪ {N}.
- `GoodDihedralInsertion.type_at_N` — its Weil–Deligne parameter at N restricted to inertia is κ ⊕ κ^N.
- `GoodDihedralInsertion.congruences` — N ≡ 1 (mod 8), N ≡ 1 modulo every prime ≤ q − 1, N ≡ −1 (mod q).
- `GoodDihedralInsertion.modular_iff` — {ρ^{(1)}_ℓ} is modular if and only if {ρ^{(2)}_ℓ} is.

Tests:
- `insertion_congruences_q13`: for q = 13 the prime N = 406561 satisfies N ≡ 1 modulo 8, 3, 5, 7, 11 and N ≡ −1 (mod 13).
- `insertion_level_two`: 13 | 406561 + 1 and 13 ∤ 406561 − 1, so κ has niveau two.
- `insertion_needs_rationality`: an inert degree-two coefficient place gives an 𝔽_{q²}-valued reduction, without certifying descent to 𝔽_q. A Frobenius trace outside 𝔽_q obstructs that descent and prevents an application of Lemma 8.2.
- `insertion_q_gt_5`: q = 5 is excluded, because Definition 2.1 asks for t > 5 and Lemma 2.1 takes t = q; the Dickson step alone uses only that q divides neither |A₄| = 12 nor |S₄| = 24, so that a solvable projective image of order divisible by q is dihedral.
- `insertion_not_general_lift_owner`: the construction gives Paso 2 only, not the four cases of Theorem 1.9.
- `insertion_crystalline_needs_weight_two`: residual weight q + 1 at q selects the Steinberg case of Theorem 1.9(4) and cannot give the crystalline Paso 2 lift.

**Lemma 2.1: the good-dihedral prime keeps the images large** (`R33.2/lemma-2-1-large-image`). Let {ρ_ℓ} be an almost strictly compatible system ramified inside S ∪ {2, 3} whose inertial type at N is that of Ind κ. Then for every prime p ∈ S₁ ∪ {2, 3}, ρ̄_p has non-solvable image. In fact ρ̄_p is good-dihedral for N with t = q: ρ̄_p|_{I_N} ≅ κ̄_p ⊕ κ̄_p^N, κ̄_p the reduction of κ in characteristic p ≠ q, still of order q; q | N + 1, q > max(Q(N(ρ̄_p)/N²), 5, p) because p and every other ramified prime lie in S₁ ∪ {2, 3}, below q, and the congruences of Lemma 8.2(ii) hold; so Lemma 6.3(i) applies. Dieulefait–Pacetti's own proof: ρ̄_p|_{D_N} is irreducible because reduction is injective on elements of order q ≠ p; a solvable image would be dihedral (Dickson, q > 5), induced from a quadratic field ramified only in S ∪ {2, 3}; N splits or ramifies there by the congruences, and both contradict the type. The hypothesis on the type at N must survive every congruence of Pasos 3–4; it does for minimal lifts in the sense of §2.3.

**Paso 3: killing the odd part of the level** (`R33.2/paso-3-killing-the-odd-level`). Let {ρ^{(2)}_ℓ} be ramified at {p₁ < … < p_r} ∪ {N}, S₁ = {p₁, …, p_r}. For i = 2, …, r, and also i = 1 when p₁ is odd, reduce the p_i-adic member modulo p_i: the residual representation has non-solvable image (Lemma 2.1), so Theorem 1.9(3) gives a minimal crystalline lift unramified at p_i, and Theorem 1.11 a system whose ramification set omits p_i, stays inside S₁ ∪ {2, 3, N} and keeps the type at N; Theorem 1.4 makes consecutive systems simultaneously modular. The result is a system ramified only in {2, N} (only at N if p₁ is odd, and then Paso 5 follows), equivalent for modularity to {ρ^{(2)}_ℓ}. The intermediate systems have weight k(ρ̄^{(i)}_{p_i}), not necessarily 2; Paso 4 restores weight 2. The lifts must be minimal in the sense of §2.3 so that the type at N is kept.

### Layer R33.3: The prime two and the auxiliary prime

*Milestones:* Lemma 2.3, the order-three type at 2; Paso 4, removing 2; Paso 5, killing the good-dihedral prime.

**Lemma 2.3: the order-three type at 2** (`R33.3/dp-dyadic-transition-and-the-order-three-type`). Let {ρ_ℓ} be an almost strictly compatible system with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1}, unramified at 3, whose Weil–Deligne representation at 2 is Steinberg up to an unramified twist, and with ρ̄₃ of non-solvable image. Since the system is unramified at 3, ρ₃ is crystalline and k(ρ̄₃) = 2. Let χ′ be a character of G_{ℚ₄} (ℚ₄ the unramified quadratic extension of ℚ₂) of order 3 and niveau two, normalised by χ′(Art(2)) = 1, with values in 𝒪 = ℤ₃[ζ], ζ² + ζ + 1 = 0, π = ζ − 1; let ρ̃₂ = Ind χ′, so ρ̃₂|_{I₂} ≅ χ′ ⊕ χ′² with trivial monodromy. This is the construction of R33.2 at (q, N) = (3, 2).
Then ρ̄₃|_{D₂} ≅ γ ⊗ (χ̄₃, c; 0, 1) with γ unramified, and either c = 0 (ρ̄₃ unramified at 2, ρ̄₃|_{D₂} ≅ γ ⊗ (η ⊕ 1)) or ρ̄₃|_{I₂} is a nontrivial unipotent. There is a G_{ℚ₂}-stable lattice Λ in ρ̃₂ with γ ⊗ (Λ/πΛ) ≅ ρ̄₃|_{D₂}: the standard lattice L₀ when c = 0, the adapted lattice L₁ = 𝒪(e₁ + e₂) ⊕ 𝒪πe₂ when c ≠ 0; L₀ does not serve when c ≠ 0. Hence ρ̃₂|_{I₂} is an inertial type compatible with ρ̄₃ at 2 in the sense of Theorem 1.9, and both reductions have trace 0 at Frobenius. A lift ρ′₃ of ρ̄₃, crystalline of weight 2 at 3, minimal away from 2 and 3, with ρ′₃|_{I₂} ≅ χ′ ⊕ χ′², exists by Theorem 1.9(4), and also by Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 5.1(4) at (p, q) = (3, 2), whose hypotheses ρ̄₃ meets: it is of S-type with k(ρ̄₃) = 2 ∈ [2, 4], absolutely irreducible over ℚ(μ₃) because its image is non-solvable, of the form (χ̄₃, ∗; 0, 1) on D₂ up to an unramified twist, and 3 | 2 + 1; χ′|_{I₂} has niveau two and order 3, and no parity condition arises since 3 is odd. Its conclusion at 3 is the parameter (1 ⊕ 1, 0), so ρ′₃ is crystalline of weight 2. Theorem 1.11 gives a system {ρ′_ℓ}, congruent to {ρ_ℓ} at 3, with the same weights and ramification and an order-three type at 2; the two are simultaneously modular (Theorem 1.4 at 3).
Proof outline: Steinberg up to the twist γ̃ gives ρ₃(Frob₂) eigenvalues γ̃(Frob₂){2, 1}, reducing to γ(Frob₂){−1, 1} since χ̄₃(Frob₂) = −1; ρ̄₃(I₂) is unipotent, so wild inertia acts trivially and I₂ acts through a tame generator σ. If ρ̄₃(σ) = 1, the distinct eigenvalues give the split case. Otherwise, in a basis whose first vector spans the inertia invariants, ρ̄₃(σ) = (1, b; 0, 1) with b ≠ 0 and ρ̄₃(Frob₂) = (α, x; 0, β); the tame relation Frob₂σFrob₂⁻¹ = σ² forces α = −β, and conjugation makes Frob₂ diagonal and b = 1. On L₀, σ ↦ D₀ = diag(ζ, ζ²), Frob₂ ↦ F₀ = (0, 1; 1, 0), reducing to 1 and to an involution with eigenvalues ±1. With P = (1, 0; 1, π), D₀P = PD₁ and F₀P = PF₁ for D₁ = (ζ, 0; ζ, ζ²) and F₁ = (1, π; 0, −1); both pairs satisfy D³ = F² = 1 and FDF⁻¹ = D², and modulo π, D₁ ≡ (1, 0; 1, 1), F₁ ≡ diag(1, −1), the non-split module. The level-two inertia-rigid condition at 2 of `LocalGaloisDeformationRings:R08.6/export-away-from-p` describes these lifts; the matrices of L₀ and L₁, after an unramified twist, are lifts of that kind, though not in the supplier's diagonal-Frobenius normal form.

API of the full local construction:
- `orderThreeCharacter` — χ′ : G_{ℚ₄} → ℤ₃[ζ]^× of order 3 and niveau two with χ′(Art(2)) = 1; on I₂ it is the niveau-two fundamental character into 𝔽₄^× ≅ μ₃.
- `orderThreeType` — ρ̃₂ = Ind χ′, with ρ̃₂|_{I₂} ≅ χ′ ⊕ χ′² and monodromy 0.
- `orderThreeType.standardLattice` — L₀: σ ↦ diag(ζ, ζ²), Frob₂ ↦ (0, 1; 1, 0).
- `orderThreeType.adaptedLattice` — L₁ = 𝒪(e₁ + e₂) ⊕ 𝒪πe₂: σ ↦ (ζ, 0; ζ, ζ²), Frob₂ ↦ (1, π; 0, −1).
- `orderThreeType_standardLattice_reduction` — L₀/πL₀ ≅ 1 ⊕ η, with trivial inertia.
- `orderThreeType_adaptedLattice_reduction` — L₁/πL₁ is the non-split extension, σ ↦ (1, 0; 1, 1), Frob₂ ↦ diag(1, −1).
- `orderThreeType_exists_lattice_reduction_iso` — if ρ̄₃|_{D₂} ≅ γ ⊗ (χ̄₃, c; 0, 1), Λ = L₀ (c = 0) or L₁ (c ≠ 0) satisfies γ ⊗ (Λ/πΛ) ≅ ρ̄₃|_{D₂}.
- `orderThreeType_isCompatible` — ρ̃₂|_{I₂} is compatible with ρ̄₃ at 2, the hypothesis of Theorem 1.9(4) at ℓ = 2.
- `typeChangeAtTwo` — {ρ_ℓ} is modular if and only if {ρ′_ℓ} is.

Tests:
- `order_three_level_two`: |𝔽₄^×| = 3 and |𝔽₂^×| = 1, so an order-3 character of tame inertia at 2 has niveau two.
- `ramification_index_three`: K = ℚ₄(χ′) has e(K/ℚ₂) = 3, which is odd.
- `steinberg_nonexample`: the Steinberg type (ω₁ ⊕ 1, N ≠ 0) has nonzero monodromy and is not potentially crystalline; the order-three type is.
- `needs_unramified_at_3`: if the system is ramified at 3, k(ρ̄₃) = 2 can fail and Theorem 1.9(4) gives no crystalline lift at 3.
- `standard_lattice_relations`: over ℤ[ζ], D₀³ = F₀² = 1, F₀D₀F₀⁻¹ = D₀², and D₀ ≡ 1 (mod π).
- `adapted_lattice_change_of_basis`: D₀P = PD₁, F₀P = PF₁, D₁³ = F₁² = 1 and F₁D₁F₁⁻¹ = D₁².
- `adapted_lattice_nonsplit`: modulo π, D₁ ≡ (1, 0; 1, 1) ≠ 1 and F₁ ≡ diag(1, −1), so L₁/πL₁ has one-dimensional inertia invariants.
- `standard_lattice_nonexample`: D₀ ≡ 1 (mod π), so L₀ cannot realise a ramified ρ̄₃|_{I₂}.
- `split_case_standard_lattice`: modulo π, F₀² = 1 and F₀ ≠ ±1, so its eigenvalues are 1 and −1 = 2 = χ̄₃(Frob₂).

**Remark 6: the dyadic weight after the type change** (`R33.3/remark-6-weight-two-after-type-change`). In Paso 4, if ρ̄₂ has non-solvable image and k(ρ̄₂) = 4, the system {ρ′_ℓ} of Lemma 2.3 has k(ρ̄′₂) = 2. The type of ρ′₂ at 2 comes from χ′ (almost strict compatibility, ρ̄′₂ irreducible by Lemma 2.1), so ρ′₂ is crystalline with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1} over K = ℚ₄(χ′), e(K/ℚ₂) = 3; it comes from a 2-divisible group and ρ̄′₂|_{G_K} is finite flat. A très ramifiée representation is finite flat over no extension of odd ramification index, so ρ̄′₂ has weight 2. This is the argument of `R27.5/dyadic-weight-two-claim`; the criterion is imported from `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.4`, not from R27.5, to keep the modern strand independent of the classical induction. The detour is needed because Theorem 1.9 gives a crystalline lift at 2 only in weight 2.

**Paso 4: removing 2 from the level** (`R33.3/paso-4-removing-two`). After Paso 3 let the system be ramified only at 2 and N. There is an almost strictly compatible system of weight 2 unramified outside N and equivalent for modularity:
1. if k(ρ̄₂) = 4, take a minimal weight-two lift with Steinberg type at 2 (Theorem 1.9(2)) and its system (transfer by Theorem 1.5); if k(ρ̄₂) = 2, go directly to step 3;
2. in the weight-four branch, change the type at 2 by Lemma 2.3, which needs the system unramified at 3 (after Paso 3) and of Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1} (after step 1);
3. now k(ρ̄₂) = 2 (Remark 6, or directly when the weight was 2), and a minimal crystalline weight-two lift (Theorem 1.9(1)) lies in a system unramified at 2 (transfer by Theorem 1.5).
Non-solvable image at 2 (Lemma 2.1) is needed for Theorems 1.9(1), 1.9(2) and 1.5. The type at N is kept by minimal lifts and by prescribing τ_N at N. The order of the steps matters: the Steinberg lift makes Lemma 2.3 applicable, and Remark 6 needs the type from Lemma 2.3.

**Paso 5: killing the good-dihedral prime** (`R33.3/paso-5-killing-the-good-dihedral-prime`). Let {ρ′_ℓ} be an almost strictly compatible system of weight 2 unramified outside N, and reduce its N-adic member modulo N.
1. If ρ̄′_N is reducible, ρ′_N is modular by Theorem 1.6 (N > 5). Only the de Rham property at N is available here (almost strict compatibility gives no Weil–Deligne information at the ramified coefficient prime N when the residual member is reducible), and Pan's theorem needs nothing more.
2. If ρ̄′_N is irreducible and not bad dihedral, a minimal crystalline lift (Theorem 1.9(3)) lies in a system with empty ramification set, equivalent for modularity (Theorem 1.4).
3. ρ̄′_N is not bad dihedral: it has level 1, and a level-one bad-dihedral representation in characteristic N needs N ≡ 3 (mod 4) (Lemma 1.14 with Wintenberger's lemma, Remark 5), while N ≡ 1 (mod 8).
ρ′_N is irreducible because other members of the system have irreducible residual representations. Case 1 is the one place where almost strict, rather than strict, compatibility matters.

### Layer R33.4: The terminal characteristic five

*Milestones:* Paso 6, the terminal characteristic five; Serre's conjecture for odd p.

**Paso 6: the level-one system at p = 5** (`R33.4/dp-terminal-characteristic-five-and-the-schoof-base-case`). Let {ρ″_ℓ} be the system with empty ramification set from Paso 5. At p = 5:
1. if ρ̄″₅ is reducible, ρ″₅ is modular by Theorem 1.6;
2. ρ̄″₅ is not bad dihedral, since the system has level 1 and 5 ≢ 3 (mod 4) (Remark 5);
3. otherwise k(ρ̄″₅) ∈ {2, 4, 6}, as level one forces an even normalised weight (det ρ̄ = χ̄₅^{k−1} after normalisation and oddness make k − 1 odd). For weight 2 or 4, a minimal crystalline lift in a system with empty ramification set has a 3-adic member with reducible reduction (Tate–Serre: nothing irreducible is unramified outside 3), ordinary by Berger–Li–Zhu since the weight is 2 or 4 = 3 + 1, hence modular by Theorem 1.7, in the form of `GL2ModularityLifting:R32.5/crystalline-weights-two-four-completion`: the semisimplified reduction is 1 ⊕ χ̄₃, the only odd sum of characters unramified outside 3, and χ̄₃|_{D₃} ≠ 1 (Dieulefait–Pacetti phrase this as: the weight is not 3). For weight 6, a weight-two lift Steinberg at 5 and unramified elsewhere (Theorem 1.9(4)) comes from a GL₂-type abelian variety A/ℚ (Snowden, Proposition 9.4.1), semistable with good reduction outside 5, contradicting Schoof; before Schoof's theorem is applied, A must be checked to be of GL₂-type, semistable at 5 and of good reduction outside 5.
In every case the system, hence ρ̄″₅ and by the chain of Pasos 1–5 the original ρ̄, is modular (Theorem 1.4 at 5 for the lifts in case 3). The terminal cases are `SmallRamificationAndAbelianVarietyBaseCases:R25.5/paso-six-terminal-cases`.

Otherwise Pasos 1 to 6 give a chain of almost strictly compatible systems, consecutive ones simultaneously modular (Theorems 1.4 and 1.5, Remark 4), ending in a modular system or a contradiction. The proof uses no weight reduction and no (L_r)/(W_r) induction; its base cases are Tate–Serre and Schoof. Weight and level are not claimed here.

### Layer R33.5: Characteristic two and the qualitative theorem

*Milestones:* characteristic two; the qualitative Serre theorem in every characteristic.

**The auxiliary odd prime for a dyadic system** (`R33.5/auxiliary-odd-prime-for-the-dyadic-system`). Let ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄₂) be irreducible with non-solvable image. Take the E-rational almost strictly compatible, irreducible, odd system of Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 5.1(1) when k(ρ̄) = 2, or 5.1(2) when k(ρ̄) = 4, whose dyadic member lifts ρ̄ with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1}; by the definitions of Khare–Wintenberger §5 every characteristic-zero member is irreducible and odd. For every prime p > 3 outside the finite ramification set and every coefficient place above p, the p-adic member ρ_p is odd, irreducible, finitely ramified and crystalline of weight 2 at p: the almost strict clause at an odd unramified prime gives crystallinity even when the reduction is reducible. ρ̄_p may be reducible; if it is irreducible it has weight 2 and is not bad dihedral, since Lemma 1.14 would force p = 2 · 2 − 1 = 3 or p = 2 · 2 − 3 = 1. Such primes p exist, since the ramification set is finite.

**Characteristic two** (`R33.5/dp-characteristic-two-closure`). Every irreducible ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄₂) is modular. If the image is solvable, the projective image is dihedral (Khare–Wintenberger Lemma 6.1: S₄ does not occur, and A₄ would lie in a Borel subgroup over 𝔽₄), and dihedral images are Rohrlich–Tunnell. If the image is non-solvable, take the dyadic system and an auxiliary prime p > 3 as above: ρ̄_p is either reducible, and ρ_p is modular by Theorem 1.6, or irreducible, odd and not bad dihedral, hence modular by the odd case, and ρ_p is modular by Theorem 1.4. By Remark 4 the system, hence ρ̄, is modular. Only the odd-characteristic theorem of R33.4 is used, not this layer's own conclusion at p = 2; no dyadic lifting theorem is needed, only the dyadic lift existence.

Suggested name: `DP.serre_weak_two`.

**The qualitative Serre theorem** (`R33.5/qualitative-serre-theorem`). For every prime p, every odd irreducible ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) is modular: ρ̄ ≅ ρ̄_{f,p} for a cuspidal eigenform f of some weight k ≥ 2, level and character. Odd p is R33.4; p = 2 is the previous target. The proof uses no target of R26 or of R27.2–R27.6. No weight or level is asserted.

Suggested name: `isModular_of_isSType` (the statement of Theorem 9.1, with a second proof).

**What the qualitative proof rests on** (`R33.5/globalisation-dependency-check`). The qualitative theorem rests on exactly:
- (a) lift existence, Theorem 1.9: cases (1)–(3) are Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 5.1, proved in their second paper, and case (4) is Gee and Snowden (`PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.3`);
- (b) almost strictly compatible systems, Theorem 1.11 (Dieulefait, through Taylor's potential modularity; `PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.5/dieulefait-families`), and modularity transfer (`PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.6/linked-systems-modularity-transfer`);
- (c) the lifting theorems 1.4–1.7 (`GL2ModularityLifting:R32.5`, `R32.6`);
- (d) Langlands–Tunnell and Rohrlich–Tunnell (`GL2AutomorphicRepresentationsAndTransfer:R17.5`, `R17.6`);
- (e) the base cases of Tate, Serre and Schoof with Snowden's realisation (`SmallRamificationAndAbelianVarietyBaseCases:R25.2`–`R25.5`);
- (f) from this roadmap, only the early R27.1 targets: the good-dihedral definition, Lemma 6.3 and Lemma 8.2, with Dickson's classification and Khare–Wintenberger Lemma 6.2(ii) (Dieulefait–Pacetti Lemma 1.14) from their owners `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.4` and `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.4`.
The modern route is independent of Khare–Wintenberger's induction, not of all of their work: it shares Theorem 5.1. It is independent of Serre's conjecture itself only if no globalisation step inside (a)–(c) invokes the general theorem. This condition concerns in particular Tung's global Breuil–Mézard inputs (the patched modules of Caraiani–Emerton–Gee–Geraghty–Paškūnas–Shin, Emerton–Paškūnas faithfulness and Theorem A.4.1 of Barnet-Lamb–Gee–Geraghty (2013)) and Gee's Theorem 4.4.12 used by Kisin. `GL2ModularityLifting:R32.6/globalisation-dependency-audit` owns that examination, separating the forms of the lifting theorems that take residual modularity as a hypothesis from those that would use the full Serre theorem; the independence claim of this layer is exactly as strong as its conclusion. Dieulefait–Pacetti attribute the removal of weight reduction to Kisin's and Pan's lifting theorems.

### Layer R33.6: The strong form from the modern proof

*Milestone:* the strong form via the modern route.

**The two notions of modularity agree** (`R33.6/modern-and-classical-modularity-agree`). For ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) odd and irreducible, the following are equivalent: (i) ρ̄ ≅ ρ̄_{f,p} for a Hecke eigenform f ∈ S_k(Γ₀(N), ε) with k ≥ 2 (Dieulefait–Pacetti); (ii) ρ̄ arises from a newform in the sense of §2.2 (Khare–Wintenberger, `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6`). (ii) ⇒ (i) because a newform is an eigenform. (i) ⇒ (ii): pass to the newform with the same eigenvalues away from the level (Atkin–Lehner) and apply Brauer–Nesbitt; the residual isomorphism is in general with the semisimplification, and irreducibility of ρ̄ makes it an isomorphism with ρ̄. Weight-one forms are handled by the Deligne–Serre congruence of R33.1. So R33.6 proves the same statement as R27.6, with one definition of modularity.
Source: [DP], Introduction, p. 1; [KW-I], §1, p. 2.
Prerequisites: `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6/s-type-arises-from-and-modular`; `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.5/deligne-serre-eigenvalue-lifting-lemma`; `R33.1/dp-target-and-the-weight-at-least-two-convention`.

**The strong form from the qualitative theorem** (`R33.6/strong-form-by-the-modern-route`). The statement of `R27.6/full-classical-serre-theorem` follows from the qualitative theorem (through the previous target) together with `R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts`, for p odd and for p = 2 with k(ρ̄) = 2 including ρ̄|_{D₂} scalar with non-dihedral projective image, and with the dyadic optimisation of `SerreWeightAndLevelOptimisation:R20.5`–`R20.6` for p = 2 with k(ρ̄) = 4. R27.4's refinement needs only modularity of ρ̄ and Khare–Wintenberger Theorems 5.1(1) and 4.1, so it can be fed by the qualitative theorem without the induction. This is a second proof of the one public theorem. Dieulefait–Pacetti cite Edixhoven, Ribet and Boston–Lenstra–Ribet for the refinement; those results do not cover the scalar dyadic case, which Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 1.2(2) states; its proof, Theorem 5.1(1) with Theorem 4.1(1) at 2, is not written out in the source and is supplied by `R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts` (§7).

Suggested name: `arisesFrom_optimal_of_isModular`.

**What each proof takes from Khare–Wintenberger** (`R33.6/two-routes-comparison`). R27.6 and R33.6 prove the same theorem.
1. Qualitative existence: the classical route uses Khare–Wintenberger §§3, 8 and 9 (the (L_r)/(W_r)/(D_r) induction with Theorems 3.1–3.4 and 9.1) and Khare's level-one theorem for (W₁); the modern route uses none of these, but shares Theorem 5.1 and the base cases.
2. Refinement: both routes pass from modularity to weight k(ρ̄) and level N(ρ̄) through `R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts`, with Lemma 6.2(i) in the dihedral case. Outside one case the refinement was known before Khare–Wintenberger (Edixhoven, Ribet, Boston–Lenstra–Ribet; Buzzard's mod-2 level lowering and Wiese in characteristic two). Khare–Wintenberger's argument is indispensable only for ρ̄|_{D₂} scalar with non-dihedral projective image (p = 2, k(ρ̄) = 2), where Buzzard's dyadic level lowering needs a multiplicity-one statement that is not known (`SerreWeightAndLevelOptimisation:R20.5/dyadic-scalar-multiplicity-one-obstruction`); there Theorem 5.1(1) with Theorem 4.1(1) at 2 supplies the level, an argument Khare–Wintenberger do not write out (§7).
3. The dyadic weight-four optimisation is common to both routes.
Comparing the prerequisite closures of the two endpoints, the modern route meets R26–R27 only in the three early R27.1 targets and in `R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts`.

**The finite-flat export from either proof** (`R33.6/elliptic-curve-export-via-either-route`). Let p ≥ 5 and ρ̄ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽̄_p) be continuous, odd and absolutely irreducible, finite at p, with det ρ̄ = χ̄_p, and assume the strong-form conclusion for this ρ̄: it arises from a newform of weight k(ρ̄), level N(ρ̄) and nebentypus reducing to ε(ρ̄). Then ρ̄ arises from a normalised newform g of weight 2, level N(ρ̄) and trivial nebentypus, with a coefficient prime λ above p and ρ̄_{g,λ} ≅ ρ̄; hence a_ℓ(g) ≡ tr ρ̄(Frob_ℓ) (mod λ) for ℓ ∤ pN(ρ̄). The local finite-flat weight recipe gives k(ρ̄) = 2 (for coefficients beyond 𝔽_p in Raynaud's 𝔽-vector-space form), the determinant gives ε(ρ̄) = 1, and Carayol's change of nebentypus at p ≥ 5 makes the character trivial at the same weight and level; the level is exactly N(ρ̄) because the prime-to-p conductor of ρ̄ divides that of every lift. The hypothesis is the strong conclusion for the fixed ρ̄, which either proof of the strong form supplies; the R27.6 export is the same argument.

## 6. Required examples and regression tests

Beyond the tests listed with the definitions above, an implementation must check the following, each of which separates a correct statement from a plausible wrong one.

- **Terminal rows.** The five rows of R26.5 with their return weights: (P, j) = (7, 2) gives 4, 6; (11, 4) gives 6, 8; (19, 8) gives 10, 12; (29, 16) gives 18, 14 and (29, 14) gives 16, 16; (31, 18) gives 20, 14. The factorisations 7 − 1 = 2 · 3, 11 − 1 = 2 · 5, 19 − 1 = 2 · 9, 29 − 1 = 4 · 7, 31 − 1 = 6 · 5 and the coset conditions modulo (P − 1)/ℓ^e. At P = 31, 6 ∤ 16 while 6 | 18 and 18 ∈ (12, 18].
- **Prime estimates.** π(31) = 11 and π(100) = 25, which refute the printed uniform bound. 257 = 2⁸ + 1 is skipped after 251, and 263/251 ≤ 3/2 − 1/30. The dyadic case (13, 17, 4) of (2) is 176 ≤ 208, strict.
- **The local quadratic of R26.2.** With α − β = γ(c − 1) and αβ = ψ, β² + βγ(c − 1) − ψ = 0; at (α, β, γ, c, ψ) = (3, 2, 1, 2, 6) the correct polynomial vanishes and the printed one is −4.
- **Auxiliary primes.** For p = 5, q = 409 satisfies 409 ≡ 1 (mod 8), ≡ 1 (mod 3), ≡ −1 (mod 5). For p′ = q = 13, N = 406561 is prime, ≡ 1 modulo 8, 3, 5, 7, 11 and ≡ −1 (mod 13). −1 is a square modulo 5 and 13 (2² + 1 ≡ 0, 5² + 1 ≡ 0).
- **Conductor bookkeeping.** N = 6 satisfies the condition of (D₁) but not of (D₀). The Steinberg parameter (id, N) with N ≠ 0 nilpotent of rank one has conductor exponent 2 − 1 = 1. In Theorem 3.4 the boundary case p = 2, k(ρ̄) = 4, r = 1 has original exponent 0 and first-system exponent A = 1 ≤ r; with r = 0 the bound would fail.
- **Bad-dihedral arithmetic.** p > 2k excludes p = 2k − 1 and p = 2k − 3; the niveau-two case is attained at p = 7, k = 5, where gcd(8, 4) = 4 and 8/4 = 2. At level one a bad-dihedral representation has p ≡ 3 (mod 4), which N ≡ 1 (mod 8) and p = 5 avoid. At weight 2 the excluded primes are 3 and 1.
- **Dyadic Dickson refinement.** An element g of 2-power order of GL₂(𝔽̄₂) is unipotent ((g − 1)^{2^n} = g^{2^n} − 1 = 0), so (g − 1)² = 0 and g has order at most 2; the same holds in PGL₂(𝔽̄₂), and since S₄ has elements of order 4 it is not a projective image in characteristic two. The Borel subgroup of PGL₂(𝔽₄) has order 12 = |A₄| while |PGL₂(𝔽₄)| = 60 = |A₅|.
- **Odd ramification index.** An odd valuation stays odd in an extension of odd ramification index and becomes even in index 2.
- **Order-three lattices.** The identities D₀³ = F₀² = 1, F₀D₀F₀⁻¹ = D₀², D₀P = PD₁, F₀P = PF₁, D₁³ = F₁² = 1, F₁D₁F₁⁻¹ = D₁², and the reductions modulo π, in exact arithmetic over ℤ[ζ]; both Frobenius matrices have trace 0.

## 7. Corrections to the sources

Every target above uses the corrected statement.

- [Kh], §6.1, p. 25 (weights 22–30): the mod-7 companion of a level-one mod-29 representation is ramified only at 7 and 29; the printed list 3, 19 is carried over from the previous row.
- [Kh], §6.1, pp. 25–26 (weight 32): the printed nebentypus exponent j = 16 is not admissible. A weight-32 = 31 + 1 representation has a minimal weight-two lift semistable at 31, so its mod-5 member is unipotent on I₃₁, and the available nebentypes are ω₃₁^{6i} (5 ∥ 30); 16 is not a multiple of 6. The interval (12, 18] gives j = 18 (j = 12 also works), with return weights 20 or 14.
- [Kh], §4, p. 19: the uniform bound A x/log x ≤ π(x) ≤ B x/log x for x > 30 with the printed constants is false (π(31) = 11 exceeds the upper bound, and so does π(100) = 25). R26.3 replaces it by Rosser–Schoenfeld with exact thresholds, the finite table and the 61/50 ratio; the auxiliary-prime conclusion is unchanged.
- [Kh], proof of Proposition 2.2, p. 15: the quadratic after AB = BA should read β² + βγ(χ′(τ) − 1) − ψ = 0; the derivative is still 2r_F modulo π, so the smoothness conclusion is unchanged.
- [KW-I], §§7–8.2, pp. 12–15: the exponent of the prime power dividing P − 1 is written r, the same letter as the fixed number of conductor primes; the two are unrelated, and this roadmap writes ℓ^e ∥ P − 1.
- [KW-I], proof of Theorem 9.1, p. 19: the system built with Theorem 5.1(4) lifts the mod-3 representation ρ̄₃, not ρ̄, and the finite flatness over an extension K of ℚ₂ of ramification index 3 comes from the local type of Theorem 5.1(4) moved to ℓ = 2 by almost strict compatibility, not from Theorem 5.1(2).
- [KW-I], §3.2 and the remark after Theorem 3.4, p. 6: Theorem 3.4 proves modularity, and the passage to weight k(ρ̄) and level N(ρ̄) claimed in Theorem 1.2, including the scalar dyadic case, is not written out. `R27.4/strong-form-by-minimal-lifts` supplies it from Theorems 4.1 and 5.1(1), Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2(i), θ-operators, Edixhoven's weight theorem and the Deligne–Serre lemma.
- [DP], Paso 2, p. 11: (N − 1)(N + 1) is the order of the unit group of the residue field 𝔽_{N²}, which itself has N² elements; and the niveau-two condition concerns the restriction of κ to the inertia group at N, not at q.
- [DP], Paso 2, p. 11: the lift ρ^{(2)}_q does not have dihedral image of order 2q at N, since det ρ^{(2)}_q(Frob_N) = ψ(N)N is not a root of unity; its inertial type at N is that of Ind κ, and the projective image of D_N is dihedral of order 2q, which is all Lemma 2.1 uses. Even Ind κ has image of order 2q only when κ(Art(N)) = 1.
- [DP], Remark 6, p. 13: flatness over some extension of even ramification index gives no contradiction. The operative fact is that a très ramifiée representation becomes finite flat over no extension of odd ramification index: up to twist it is given by a Kummer class of odd valuation, which over K has valuation e(K/ℚ₂) times as large, and it is finite flat over K exactly when that valuation is even; so it becomes flat over ℚ₂(√x) (index 2) but over no extension of odd ramification index.
- [DP], definition of minimal lift, p. 6, Lemma 2.1, p. 11, Pasos 3–4, pp. 12–13: with Dieulefait–Pacetti's definition, under which a minimal lift need only be unramified at the primes ℓ ≠ p where ρ̄ is unramified, a lift of ρ̄_{p_i} could have type Ind(κε) at N with ε of p_i-power order, and Lemma 2.1 would not apply to the new system. The lifts must be minimal in the sense of §2.3, which Khare–Wintenberger Theorem 5.1 provides; then the type at N is kept.
- [Ri], proof of Proposition 2.2, p. 280 (dihedral case): the subgroup containing the cyclic inertia image is the index-two rotation subgroup, not the centre, which has at most two elements.
- [Sa], Theorem 6.12(4) of the published version, case i = 1: in the exceptional case m = 1 + (p + 1)j the characters ω₂^{m+p} and ω₂^{pm+1} coincide and have niveau one, and the residual representation is split; the author corrects the published lattice statement in Remark 1.7 of arXiv v3, p. 4. Only Theorem 6.11, Corollary 6.15 and Remark 6.17 of v3 are used.

## 8. Source notes

- [Kh] is cited in the page numbers of arXiv v1. It was published, with a different title, in Duke Math. J. 134 (2006). [KW-I] refer to Theorems 5.1 and 6.1 of the published version, numbers that do not occur in arXiv v1, where the compatible-system result is Proposition 3.1. R26.6 specifies the step that uses Theorem 6.1(2) by its content.
- [KW-I] is cited in the running page numbers (2–21) of the authors' preprint, not the Inventiones pages. Its Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 are proved in the sequel, Khare–Wintenberger, Serre's modularity conjecture (II), Invent. Math. 178 (2009), 505–586; this roadmap uses them as stated, through `GL2ModularityLifting:R22.5`–`R22.6` and `PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R24.3`–`R24.6`.
- [DP] is cited in the pages of arXiv v2. The theorems it imports (Kisin, Emerton, Paškūnas, Hu–Tan, Tung, Skinner–Wiles, Pan, Gee, Snowden, Dieulefait, Berger–Li–Zhu) are cited here through the layers that own them.
- [BM] is cited in the running pages of the authors' copy. Proposition 6.1.1 concerns the nonscalar principal-series type ω_p^i ⊕ 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ p − 2, with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1} and any stable lattice, without an End(ρ̄) = 𝔽 condition; the paper leaves out the details of its computation, which the integral classification of `FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory:R07.5` supplies.
- The weight-one step and the descent of R27.6 go back to Gross's companion forms, Coleman–Voloch, Edixhoven's weight paper with its note on the exceptional case, and Khare's note on mod p forms of weight one (Internat. Math. Res. Notices 1997, corrigendum 1999). The proofs given in R27.6 are complete from the listed prerequisites; the form of the weight-one step without a hypothesis on Frob_ℓ rests on Coleman–Voloch through `SerreWeightAndLevelOptimisation:R20.3/edixhoven-weight-theorem`. The Artin argument uses the distinct-Frobenius form; the general form is supplied to `ModularityAndLanglandsExtensions:ML.1` for irregular compatible systems.
- The residually dihedral ordinary branch of the level-one proof for ρ̄ induced from ℚ(√−p) rests on Skinner's correction to Skinner–Wiles, which is unpublished (Khare–Wintenberger cite it as "to appear"); this roadmap requires that case from `OrdinaryAutomorphicFormsAndModularityLifting:R21.5`. A lifting theorem excluding induction from an imaginary quadratic field cannot supply this branch.

## 9. Suggested Lean forms

[`Suggested.lean`](Suggested.lean) proposes names and signatures; it is not exhaustive and this README is definitive. Its names are in the namespace `TauCeti.SerreConjecture`; the declarations of the modern route R33.1–R33.5 and the lattice computations of R33.3 are in `TauCeti.SerreConjecture.DP`. It imports individual Mathlib modules and Tau Ceti’s pinned newform module, and elaborates against both pinned libraries with `sorry` as its only warning.

It works with Mathlib's absolute Galois group, and fixes the following.

| --- | --- |
| `GQ`, `IntBar`, `FpBar p` | G_ℚ = Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ) as `AlgebraicClosure ℚ ≃ₐ[ℚ] AlgebraicClosure ℚ`, the algebraic integers, and 𝔽̄_p. |
| `IsFrobAt`, `IsUnramifiedAt`, `primeAbove`, `inertiaAt`, `galoisInertia` | Frobenius elements through `IsArithFrobAt`; unramifiedness through inertia groups of primes of `IntBar`; the inertia group at a chosen prime above q and its inclusion. |
| `IsOdd`, `IsIrreducible`, `toRepresentation`, `isIrreducible_iff`, `IsAbsIrreducible`, `IsSType`, `IsProjConj` | Oddness through complex conjugations (`ComplexEmbedding.IsConj`); irreducibility as "no stable line", with its equivalence to Mathlib's `Representation.IsIrreducible`; absolute irreducibility in Burnside's form; S-type; conjugacy in the projective image. |
| `fixedVectors`, `residualRep`, `genericRep`, `primesOfRat`, `auxLevel` | Invariants of a subgroup, reduction modulo the maximal ideal, extension to the fraction field, rational primes for `NumberField.Set.HasDirichletDensity`, and the level N′ of the weight-one statements. |
| `artinConductor`, `serreWeight` | Stand-ins for N(ρ̄) (and the Artin conductor in characteristic zero) and for k(ρ̄), owned by `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.3` and `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.4`. |
| `Newform` with `level`, `weight`, `character`, `ResidualPlace`, `residualRep` | Bundle of the existing `HeckeRing.GL2.Newform` over positive levels and weights, with the residual representations at the primes above p supplied by `AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations` and `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6`. |
| `KatzCuspForms`, `katzHecke`, `katzDiamond`, `katzBaseChange` | Stand-ins for Katz cusp forms, Hecke and diamond operators and base change (`AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.1`–`R15.2`). |
| `WeightOneNewform` with `level`, `character`, `coeff`, `galoisRep` | Bundle of the existing `HeckeRing.GL2.Newform N 1`, with a stand-in for its Deligne–Serre representation ([ModularForms, Layer 4][mf], `AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations:R19.1`). |
| `ArisesFrom`, `IsModular`, `ArisesFrom.isModular`, `arisesFrom_conj` | "Arises from" and "modular", defined from the stand-ins as in §2.2 for irreducible ρ̄ (the stand-in reduction is semisimplified; owner `AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights:R15.6`), with their first API. |

Every stand-in is data; no condition is a `Prop`-valued placeholder. The headline statements (the level-one theorem, Corollaries 1.2 and 8.1(ii), the hypotheses (L_r), (W_r), (D_r) and the theorems linking them, Theorem 1.2, Theorem 9.1, the strong form, the qualitative theorem and the weight-one statements) are therefore real propositions about the existing Galois group.

The good-dihedral predicate is stated for any group with supplied inertia homomorphisms and specialised to G_ℚ as `IsGoodDihedralRep`. The file gives the local characters on the absolute Galois group of ℚ_N, their induced representations, both full stable lattices and their distinct reductions, and the global insertion and type-change contracts. The tests include the invariant dimensions of L₀ and L₁, the obstruction to prime-field descent and the crystalline versus Steinberg lift alternatives.

`ImportedInterfaces.Member` fixes an integral model over the integers of a finite extension of ℚ_p, with its valuation topology and residue embedding. `CompatibleSystem` indexes these members by the coefficient field’s places and states Frobenius, Hodge–Tate and Weil–Deligne compatibility; the last comparison is up to Frobenius-semisimplified isomorphism and retains the reducible-residual exceptions of §2.3. The unavailable period-module dimensions, finite-flat models, local deformation functors and Galois attachments remain data-valued supplier adapters. The lifting, system-transition, Artin and weight-one assertions are propositions about these objects. The globalisation audit and the proof-route comparison remain mathematical dependency documentation, rather than artificial logical certificates.

The exact integer and matrix calculations use `decide`, `norm_num`, `ring` or `omega` where practical; the other signatures and examples use `sorry`. These are proposed interfaces, not proofs of modularity. The local cyclotomic character is imported from LocalGaloisGroups, and the tame frame and reciprocity data from LocalFieldsRamification and ClassFieldTheory; those existing developments are not new targets of this roadmap.
