# Reusable infrastructure for potential automorphy over CM fields, Part II

## Purpose

This roadmap develops P-ordinary degree shifting, crystalline local–global compatibility and potentially Barsotti–Tate automorphy lifting over imaginary CM fields. It extends **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure** beyond its Fontaine–Laffaille and Borel-ordinary results. The first endpoint controls the local deformation conditions of Galois representations valued in integral and torsion Hecke algebras. The second applies that control to two-dimensional automorphy lifting. The crystalline argument allows small residue characteristic, ramification at p and regular weights outside a Fontaine–Laffaille interval.

The construction runs through integral Siegel parahorics and their rescaled coefficient actions, derived P-ordinary control, weight independence, Bruhat subquotients, a localized completed-boundary summand, and degree shifting into unitary middle degree. Characteristic-zero unitary eigensystems then supply crystalline Galois blocks. A separating twist and compatible constituent reconstruction carry the local information to torsion Hecke systems. For the lifting application, a pair of patched complexes with the same residual fiber propagates automorphic support between deformation components.

The potentially Barsotti–Tate endpoint has the explicit restriction

\[
[F(\zeta_p):F]\ne3\quad\text{or}\quad
\operatorname{im}(\overline\rho)^{\mathrm{proj}}\not\cong A_4.
\]

This restriction is needed by the finite-image argument specified in Layer CL.9. It holds automatically at p=3 and p=5, the primes used by the elliptic-curve applications. The statement here makes no assertion about the unrestricted cubic-tetrahedral case.

Suggested home: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Automorphy/CrystallineCM/`. The companion [Suggested.lean](Suggested.lean) proposes declaration names and interfaces; the mathematical specification is this document.

## Scope and ownership

The parent **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure** supplies its algebraic coefficient dictionary, CTG weight machinery, ordinary tower and Siegel-boundary infrastructure. This extension owns the integral P-ordinary comparison and arbitrary-prime degree-shifting argument, their crystalline and semistable-ordinary local–global consequences, and their two-component patching application. Its constructions retain the parent interfaces and the explicit extensions described below.

Arithmetic locally symmetric spaces, their Borel–Serre compactifications, finite-level local systems, cochain models and finite-cover descent belong to **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces**. **CompletedCohomologyPartII** owns assembly of those objects into arithmetic towers, their smooth level colimits, completion, completed equivariant chain models, continuous descent and the completed boundary triangle. Smooth representation categories, general induction, derived invariants and local Hecke algebras belong to **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups**. Continuous profinite cohomology belongs to Tau Ceti's **ProfiniteCohomology** roadmap. General Koszul complexes and the abstract derived patching and length arguments belong to **DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra**. These objects enter here through their supplier interfaces.

**AutomorphicGaloisRepresentationsPartII** owns the Galois representations of characteristic-zero automorphic representations and their required local comparisons. **IgusaVarietiesAndTorsionConcentration** owns the middle-degree concentration result. **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants** owns determinants, uniform nilpotent Galois interpolation and compatible local reconstruction. **PadicHodgeTheory**, **LocalGaloisDeformationRings** and **GlobalGaloisDeformations** own the p-adic Hodge-theoretic categories, local lifting rings, deformation functors and Taylor–Wiles prime selection. This roadmap applies those theories with the coefficient, weight, determinant and dimension conventions fixed here.

Solvable CM preparation and automorphic base change/descent are supplied by **PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems** and **ModularityAndLanglandsExtensions**. The sibling **EllipticCurveModularityImaginaryQuadratic** consumes the two-dimensional lifting statements and owns the residual-modularity, modular-curve and Jacquet–Langlands applications. No elliptic-curve geometry is a target of the present roadmap.

Each layer lists the precise supplier stage identifiers it consumes. An interface described under “Required supplier interfaces” is part of that supplier's mathematics; its use does not authorize a second definition or a weaker substitute here. In particular, an abstract algebraic representation does not supply smoothness, an ordinary derived category does not supply arithmetic towers, and a finite-flat reconstruction theorem does not cover a torsion Hecke target without its specified extension.

## Mathematical conventions

The standing conventions below apply to the layers unless a target explicitly changes its field, rank or coefficient assumptions. Rank-one and empty-rank tests exercise the local algebraic constructions; the arithmetic endpoints have n≥2. In the characteristic-zero GL_n endpoint, F is allowed to be totally real and F⁺=F. The non-neat PGL₂ constructions in CL.8–CL.9 have their own perfectness hypotheses.

1. F is an imaginary CM field, F⁺ its maximal totally real subfield, n≥2, p a prime; all places of F⁺ above p split in F when unitary parahorics are used. The coefficient field E/Q_p is finite and contains all relevant embeddings, O is its integer ring, k its residue field, and ϖ its uniformizer. Local uniformizers ϖ_v are distinct notation.
2. G=Res_{F/F⁺}GL_n; G̃ is the quasi-split U(n,n) with form J=(0,Ψ_n;−Ψ_n,0), P its Siegel parabolic, M≅G the lower-right Levi; fix split-place identifications ι_ṽ. The algebraic coefficient lattice is the integral dual Weyl lattice, not an arbitrary characteristic-zero lattice. Good level means a neat factorizable compact open, with the standard integral p-components; apply the explicit non-neat construction only in CL.8–CL.9.
3. Weights λ_{τ,1}≥⋯≥λ_{τ,n}; the unitary dictionary (2.1.4) is λ̃_τ=(−λ_{τ̃c,n},…,−λ_{τ̃c,1},λ_{τ̃,1},…,λ_{τ̃,n}). Thus the paper’s abbreviated (−λ_{τ̃c},λ_{τ̃}) always includes reversal in the first block. Hodge–Tate convention HT(ε_p^{-1})=+1; Art sends a uniformizer to geometric Frobenius.
4. For good v outside T, P_v(X)=Σ_{i=0}^n(−1)^i q_v^{i(i−1)/2}T_{v,i}X^{n−i}, T_{v,0}=1. For G̃ replace n by 2n and i by j, including X^{2n−j} in every term. d=n²[F⁺:Q] is the complex dimension of X̃; dim_R X_G=d−1.
5. Whenever the §2.1.20 Galois theorem is invoked: F contains an imaginary quadratic field; T⊇S_p, T=T^c; for each v∉T of residue characteristic ℓ, either T has no ℓ-adic places and ℓ is unramified in F, or ℓ splits in an imaginary quadratic subfield of F. A non-Eisenstein m means its associated residual n-dimensional representation is absolutely irreducible. Decomposed generic means some rational ℓ≠p splits completely in F, the residual representation is unramified at all v|ℓ, and no ratio of two Frobenius eigenvalues equals ℓ. The ambient 2n-dimensional Satake representation must separately satisfy this condition where specified.

Use 𝔪 for a maximal Hecke ideal and m for a coefficient exponent; legacy subscripts m on Galois representations and Hecke localizations mean 𝔪. Let R_m=O/ϖ^m. The notation (−λ_{τ̃c},λ_{τ̃}) includes reversal of the first n-block, as in the displayed unitary weight dictionary. Conjugated and dual comparisons change the block orientation explicitly. Geometric congruence depth uses the local uniformizer ϖ_v, while coefficient reduction uses ϖ∈O.

POrd inverts the single rescaled Siegel operator ũ_n at each selected place. QOrd requires valuation-zero eigenvalues for every rescaled partial block operator. General smooth ordinary localization and finite-module ordinary projectors have distinct interfaces. Integral induction and Satake are unnormalized; the characteristic-zero Jacquet argument uses its separately normalized supplier.

CL.0 identifies this carrier with the relative Siegel Weyl element; it does not define a second block-permutation library.

The finite Fitting decomposition assumes both Artinian and Noetherian module conditions. Over a p-adic field it distinguishes zero eigenvalues from nonzero eigenvalues; selecting valuation-zero eigenvalues is the separate PadicFamilies interface. Algebraic `Representation` has no continuity or smoothness condition. `DerivedCategory` requires an abelian category and its localization construction, and does not create the smooth or arithmetic coefficient category. An `AlgHom` range describes a Hecke image only after its actual action has been built. Artin–Rees controls a filtration shift, which permits increasing m to m′ in CL.3 and CL.6.

## The build

The sequence of layers follows the mathematics, with independent inputs named at their point of use.

| Layer | Construction and output |
|---|---|
| CL.0 | Integral Siegel parahorics, positive monoids and lowest-weight rescaling |
| CL.1 | Finite-level and completed derived P-ordinary control |
| CL.2 | Independence of selected weights, including dual coefficients |
| CL.3 | Bruhat subquotients, compact unipotent cohomology and deep-level splitting |
| CL.4 | Q-ordinary characteristic-zero automorphic representations and crystalline blocks |
| CL.5 | The localized completed Siegel-boundary summand |
| CL.6 | Integral and torsion degree shifting modulo uniformly nilpotent ideals |
| CL.7 | Crystalline and semistable-ordinary local–global compatibility |
| CL.8 | Common-residual patching and non-neat PGL₂ cohomology |
| CL.9 | Prepared deformation data and qualified potentially Barsotti–Tate lifting |

The integral evaluation map is surjective and its kernel is killed modulo ϖ^m by a power of the rescaled Siegel operator. Inverting that operator makes the selected algebraic weight disappear from completed cohomology except for its Levi tensor factor. Taking derived compact Levi invariants recovers the finite-level object and its boundary counterpart. This fixes the actions before any degree comparison.

The Bruhat filtration of unnormalized parabolic induction produces Hecke-equivariant subquotients. Its open stratum exchanges the two Levi blocks; its identity stratum gives a cohomological shift and the determinant-unit orientation character. The filtration must be retained: these conclusions do not identify the whole induced representation with the direct sum of its strata.

On the complementary p-adic places, zero selected weights reduce the unipotent coefficient complex to continuous cochains of O_L^{n²}. After sufficiently deep Levi restriction, those cochains split into their cohomology groups, which are coefficient-valued duals of exterior powers. If D=[F⁺:Q], d=n²D and R is the sum of complementary local degrees, then 2R≥D and q≥⌊d/2⌋ imply

\[
d-q\le\lceil d/2\rceil\le n^2\lceil D/2\rceil\le n^2R.
\]

Thus unipotent cohomology supplies the degree needed to reach unitary middle degree, including odd d. Artin–Rees permits an increase of coefficient exponent and congruence depth to compare torsion subquotients. The nilpotence exponent depends only on n and D; the auxiliary depth can depend on the input.

The generic middle-degree injection is a statement about the ambient 2n-dimensional Satake residual representation. It must be checked independently of irreducibility of its n-dimensional Levi constituent. The exact concentration input is **IgusaVarietiesAndTorsionConcentration:IG.7/middle-degree-without-length-hypothesis**. CTG middle-degree eigensystems come from cuspidal Q-ordinary unitary representations. Their crystalline diagonal blocks, determinant formulas and Hodge–Tate lists identify the local conditions through constituent reconstruction. A local finite-flat lift may depend on the selected place, cohomological degree and coefficient exponent; no common globally automorphic lift of every torsion class is asserted.

For PGL₂ over a CM field, the rational cohomology range is [D,2D], so q₀=l₀=D. The two perfect patched complexes carry a fixed identification of their residual fibers. Their finite derived Hecke actions define support modulo nilpotent ideals. The dimension and length identities propagate that support through corresponding special-fiber generic points and their unique generic generalizations. An action on a strict chain model by the entire deformation ring is not an input.

## Layer CL.0: Siegel parahorics and integral coefficient actions

Fix the lower-right GL_n Levi of split U(n,n), descending dual Weyl weights and geometric Frobenius. Construct Siegel block exchange using existing finite permutations; define P(b,c) by C≡0 mod ϖ_v^c and A,D≡1 mod ϖ_v^b, c≥b≥0,c≥1; define positive central block cocharacters and the resulting positive parahoric monoid. Prove positivity and the commutative monoid-Hecke isomorphism. Define separate unitary and Levi lowest-weight characters using their respective longest Weyl elements and the action α(g)^{-1}ρ(g), prove lattice stability and surjective Levi coefficient evaluation, and identify the U_v residual determinant eigenvalue.

**Layer prerequisites:** **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.1**; **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.3**; **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants:IHG.3**; **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants:IHG.5**; **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.0**; **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.1**; **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.2**; **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.0:abelian-category**; **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.4**.

**Siegel block-exchange Weyl element** (`CrystallineCM.WeylElements`). The Siegel block-exchange element w₀^P of the split GL_{2n} Weyl group is w₀^G w₀^{G̃}, where the generic longest permutations are imported. On Fin(2n) it sends i<n to i+n and i≥n to i−n; its square is 1. It is the longest relative representative in ^PW^P. Use the existing longest Weyl permutations to realize this block exchange.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.WeylElements_apply`: For the Siegel exchange e on Fin(2n), e(i)=i+n for i<n and i−n otherwise.
- `CrystallineCM.WeylElements_involutive`: e∘e=id, so conjugation twice returns the original Levi action.
- `CrystallineCM.WeylElements_levi_conjugation`: Conjugation by the exchange permutation matrix sends diag(A,D) to diag(D,A), without transpose or inversion.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.WeylElements_test_n_one`: At n=1 the exchange swaps the two coordinates.
- `CrystallineCM.WeylElements_test_n_zero`: At n=0 it is the unique permutation of the empty set.
- `CrystallineCM.WeylElements_test_not_reverse`: At n=2 the exchange sends (0,1,2,3) to (2,3,0,1), whereas the full longest element sends it to (3,2,1,0).

**Surjectivity of evaluation at the identity** (`CrystallineCM.coefficient_evaluation_surjective`). Let P_{n,n} ⊂ GL_{2n} be the block upper-triangular parabolic with Levi GL_n × GL_n, so that V_{λ̃_τ} is the evaluation of (Ind_{P_{n,n}}^{GL_{2n}} V_{λ_τ̃} ⊗ V_{−w_{0,n}λ_{τ̃c}})_{/O}. The natural P_{n,n}(O)-equivariant morphism V_{λ̃_τ} → V_{λ_τ̃} ⊗ V_{−w_{0,n}λ_{τ̃c}} given by evaluation of functions at the identity is surjective.

Prerequisites: **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.1** (arithmetic local system); **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.0** (unitary levi weight dictionary); **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.0**.

**Parahoric levels P_{v̄}(b,c), Q_{v̄}, the operators Ũ and the monoids Δ̃** (`CrystallineCM.ParahoricPVBC`). For c≥b≥0, c≥1, under ι_ṽ define P_{v̄}(b,c)⊂GL_{2n}(O_{F_ṽ}) by C≡0 mod ϖ_ṽ^c in g=(A B;C D), A≡D≡1_n mod ϖ_ṽ^b. P_{v̄}(0,1) is the Siegel parahoric. For Q⊂P standard, 𝒬 is the inverse image of Q(k_ṽ) under reduction; its Levi intersection is K_Q. These are integral compact-open subgroups, with b=0 imposing no diagonal congruence.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.ParahoricPVBC_mem_iff`: g=(A B;C D) belongs iff C is divisible by ϖ_v^c and A−1,D−1 by ϖ_v^b.
- `CrystallineCM.ParahoricPVBC_antitone_depth`: For b′≥b,c′≥c satisfying validity, P(b′,c′)⊂P(b,c).
- `CrystallineCM.ParahoricPVBC_levi_quotient`: The block-diagonal reduction gives P(0,c)/P(b,c)≅GL_n(O_v/ϖ_v^b)×GL_n(O_v/ϖ_v^b), for c≥b.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.ParahoricPVBC_test_b_zero`: P(0,1) allows arbitrary invertible diagonal blocks and arbitrary upper-right integral block.
- `CrystallineCM.ParahoricPVBC_test_n_one`: For n=1,b=c=1, (1 1;0 1) belongs while (1 0;1 1) does not.
- `CrystallineCM.ParahoricPVBC_test_diagonal_not_unipotent`: For residue field F₃, diag(2,1) belongs to P(0,1) but not P(1,1).

Prerequisites: **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.2** (unitary ordinary tower); **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.0:abelian-category**.

**The eigenvalue of U_v on localized cohomology** (`CrystallineCM.residual_central_hecke_eigenvalue`). Let m ⊂ T^T(K,λ) be as in CN, Theorem 2.1.20 with k = k(m), and v a p-adic place of F. Then the Hecke operator U_v has a unique eigenvalue on H^*(X_K, V_λ/ϖ)_m, equal to ε̄_p^{n(n−1)/2}(Art_{F_v}(ϖ_v)) · det ρ̄_m(Art_{F_v}(ϖ_v)).

Source: CN, Lemma 2.1.21, pp.22–23.

Prerequisites: **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants:IHG.5**; **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants:IHG.3** (gln satake coefficients); **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.3** (hecke operator formula); **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.3**.

**Positive central cocharacters** (`CrystallineCM.PositiveCentralCocharacters`). For Q with consecutive block sizes n₁,…,n_t refining (n,n), X_Q consists of central cocharacters constant on each block with integer exponents a₁≥⋯≥a_t. Evaluation at ϖ gives diag(ϖ^{a₁}1_{n₁},…,ϖ^{a_t}1_{n_t}); partial cocharacters have a₁=⋯=a_k=1 and the rest 0. Central overall shifts are allowed, including negative shifts.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.PositiveCentralCocharacters_mem_iff`: A block-central tuple belongs to X_Q iff a₁≥⋯≥a_t.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveCentralCocharacters_add`: X_Q is closed under addition, and evaluation sends addition to multiplication of diagonal matrices.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveCentralCocharacters_partial`: The k-th tuple (1,…,1,0,…,0) belongs; k=t is the invertible scalar tuple.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.PositiveCentralCocharacters_test_two_blocks`: For (n,n), exponent tuples (1,0) and (−1,−2) are positive; (0,1) is not.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveCentralCocharacters_test_central_scalar`: For any allowed Q⊂P, a scalar tuple (a,…,a), including a<0, belongs to X_Q; this does not require the out-of-scope Q=GL_{2n}.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveCentralCocharacters_test_root_pairing`: For the block boundary simple root a_k−a_{k+1} is the pairing, so the cone agrees with the reductive-group dominant cone.

Source: CN, §2.1.13, p.19.

Prerequisites: **CL.0**: Parahoric levels P_{v̄}(b,c), Q_{v̄}, the operators Ũ and the monoids Δ̃.

**Positive parahoric monoid** (`CrystallineCM.PositiveParahoricMonoid`). Δ̃^Q=⋃_{ν∈X_Q}𝒬ν(ϖ)𝒬⊂G̃(L); Δ^{Q,+}=Δ̃^Q∩G(L), and Δ^Q is obtained by adjoining the inverse of ũ_n to Δ^{Q,+}. The semidirect submonoid acting through P is Δ^{Q,+}⋉U₀. Δ^Q inverts ũ_n, not every positive partial block cocharacter.

In the split local matrix model, take a discrete valuation ring O_v, its fraction
field L and an irreducible local uniformizer π. Let I index the matrix rows and
let b:I→{0,…,t−1} record the consecutive blocks of Q. The integral parahoric
consists of the invertible matrices q over O_v satisfying q_{ij}∈(π) whenever
b(j)<b(i). Embed it in GL_I(L) by the existing general-linear-group map on the
inclusion O_v→L. For a∈X_Q, let d_a have diagonal entry π^{a_{b(i)}} in row i.
The carrier of Δ̃^Q is exactly the set of q₁d_aq₂ with both q_i in that integral
parahoric and a∈X_Q. It is a submonoid with this carrier, rather than the closure
of a larger set that might contain additional double cosets. The identity uses
a=0; multiplication uses the Iwahori decomposition and the two root-group
contraction inequalities of CN Lemma 2.1.15(1–2), p.20.

Pull this submonoid back along the fixed Levi homomorphism ι:G(L)→GL_I(L).
Membership is equivalent to membership of ι(g) in the displayed matrix monoid;
multiplication is inherited from G(L). Its extension Δ^Q is the submonoid of
G(L) generated by Δ^{Q,+} and ũ_n⁻¹. Centrality of ũ_n implies that an element
of this extension can be written ũ_n^{-k}g with k≥0 and g∈Δ^{Q,+}. For any
monoid T and homomorphism f:Δ^{Q,+}→T for which f(ũ_n) is a unit, there is
exactly one extension to Δ^Q. For a representation, T is the monoid of linear
endomorphisms, so the hypothesis requires invertibility of just the selected
operator. The arithmetic specialization supplies the actual split-place Levi
embedding, its central Siegel element and the contracting action on U₀. The
DVR matrix formula alone does not assert compactness, openness or smoothness;
those use the topology of the local field and the corresponding supplier APIs.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.PositiveParahoricMonoid_double_coset`: Each g∈𝒬ν(ϖ)𝒬 with ν∈X_Q maps to Δ̃^Q.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveParahoricMonoid_levi_intersection`: Its intersection with the embedded G(L) is exactly Δ^{Q,+}, with the same multiplication.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveParahoricMonoid_localization`: A Δ^{Q,+}-action with ũ_n invertible extends uniquely to Δ^Q.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.PositiveParahoricMonoid_test_identity`: The zero cocharacter gives all of 𝒬, including the identity.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveParahoricMonoid_test_negative_central`: ϖ^{-1}1_{2n} belongs because its block-exponent differences are zero.
- `CrystallineCM.PositiveParahoricMonoid_test_partial_inverse`: For two blocks diag(1_n,ϖ1_n) is not positive although it is invertible in G̃(L); positivity is not the whole group.

Prerequisites: **CL.0**: Positive central cocharacters; **CL.0**: Parahoric levels P_{v̄}(b,c), Q_{v̄}, the operators Ũ and the monoids Δ̃.

**Positivity, monoid property and Hecke algebra isomorphism for Δ̃^Q** (`CrystallineCM.positive_parahoric_hecke_iso`). (1) For ν ∈ X_{Q_{v̄}}, ν(ϖ_{v̄}) is 𝒬_{v̄}-positive: ν(ϖ)(N_Q ∩ 𝒬)ν(ϖ)^{−1} ⊂ N_Q ∩ 𝒬 and ν(ϖ)^{−1}(N̄_Q ∩ 𝒬)ν(ϖ) ⊂ N̄_Q ∩ 𝒬. (2) Δ̃^{Q}_{v̄} is a monoid. (3) [(M_Q ∩ 𝒬)ν(ϖ)(M_Q ∩ 𝒬)] ↦ [𝒬 ν(ϖ) 𝒬] is a ring isomorphism H(M_Q ∩ Δ̃^Q, M_Q ∩ 𝒬) ≅ H(Δ̃^Q, 𝒬), factoring through an isomorphism to H(Δ^{Q,+}, G(F⁺_{v̄}) ∩ 𝒬); in particular H(Δ̃^Q, 𝒬) is commutative.

Prerequisites: **CL.0**: Parahoric levels P_{v̄}(b,c), Q_{v̄}, the operators Ũ and the monoids Δ̃; **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.4**; **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.3** (hecke composition); **CL.0**: Positive parahoric monoid; **CL.0**: Positive central cocharacters.

**Lowest-weight scaling character** (`CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter`). For the dual Weyl weight λ̃ and Q, define α̃_λ̃:Δ̃^Q→E×, trivial on 𝒬, by α̃_λ̃(ν(ϖ))=∏_τ τ(ϖ)^{⟨ν,w₀^{G̃}λ̃_τ⟩}. Separately define α_λ:Δ^Q→E×, trivial on K_Q, by α_λ(ν(ϖ))=∏_τ τ(ϖ)^{⟨ν,w₀^Gλ̃_τ⟩}, with ν in the actual lower-right/conjugate-dual Levi embedding and w₀^G reversing each n-block. Extend the latter to inverse powers of ũ_n. The two longest Weyl elements differ; equality of α̃ restricted to the Levi and α_λ is not asserted.

The algebraic construction takes a monoid D, a field E, a finite set of embeddings, units π_τ=τ(ϖ), integer weight rows λ_τ and a central-exponent homomorphism e:D→(ℤ^r,+). For a Weyl permutation w, its value at g is the product of π_τ raised to Σ_i e(g)_i λ_{τ,w⁻¹(i)}. Integer exponents include negative central cocharacters. Additivity of e gives a monoid character with values in E×. In the split unitary case r=2n and w reverses all coordinates; in the Levi case w reverses the two n-blocks separately. For the latter permutation, compose the full reversal with the Siegel block exchange. The arithmetic monoids supply their own exponent maps and compact submonoids on which e vanishes; identifying these maps from the parahoric double cosets and the conjugate-dual Levi embedding is required before applying the construction to either arithmetic character.

For adjoining ũ_n⁻¹, take a monoid H generated by the image of D and the inverse of the selected unit representing ũ_n. An exponent map on H extending e constructs the extended character; generation makes it unique, and its value on this inverse is α_λ(ũ_n)⁻¹. This does not require every positive partial-block cocharacter to become invertible. The inverse-rescaling convention then uses α_λ(g)⁻¹ρ(g). The scalar character alone does not identify a coefficient lattice or prove lattice stability: those statements use the integral dual-Weyl evaluation and splitting. In particular, PA.0's ACC lowest-weight character, whose uniformizer value is normalized to 1 and whose compact-unit value records the weight, has a different normalization and cannot substitute for this compact-trivial rescaling character.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter_compact`: α̃(q)=1 for q∈𝒬.
- `CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter_cocharacter`: α̃(ν(ϖ))=∏_τ τ(ϖ)^{⟨ν,w₀λ̃_τ⟩}.
- `CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter_mul`: Each of α̃ and α_λ is multiplicative on its own monoid; the Levi character extends uniquely when ũ_n is inverted. Their relation in coefficient comparison uses the explicit w₀^P block exchange, rather than equality by restriction.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter_test_zero_weight`: For λ̃=0, α̃ is the trivial character.
- `CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter_test_rank_one`: For GL₂, λ̃=(a,b) and ν=(1,0), α̃(ν(ϖ))=ϖ^b at the identity embedding.
- `CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter_test_compact_value`: A compact parahoric element has α̃=1, agreeing with the original integral lattice action.
- `CrystallineCM.LowestWeightScalingCharacter_test_distinct_weyl`: For n=2, λ̃=(1,1,0,0) and ν=(1,1,0,0), α̃(ν(ϖ))=1 while α_λ(ν(ϖ))=ϖ² at one embedding. Equality by restriction would fail this allowed Siegel example.

**Rescaled actions of the monoids on coefficient lattices** (`CrystallineCM.RescaledActions`). For an E-linear representation ρ of Δ̃^Q and its lowest-weight scaling character α̃, define ρ^{scaled}(g)=α̃(g)^{-1}ρ(g). The lattice and integral coefficient sheaf use its restriction provided Lemma 2.1.17 holds. The Levi action similarly uses α_λ^{-1}; rescaled ũ_n acts as identity on V_λ. Multiplying by α rather than its inverse gives the wrong integral action.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.RescaledActions_apply`: ρ_scaled(g)x=α(g)^{-1}ρ(g)x.
- `CrystallineCM.RescaledActions_one_mul`: ρ_scaled is a monoid representation: its identity is identity and products act by composed operators.
- `CrystallineCM.RescaledActions_intertwiner`: An E-linear ρ-intertwiner for the same character α remains an intertwiner after rescaling.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.RescaledActions_test_trivial_character`: If α=1, rescaling returns the original representation.
- `CrystallineCM.RescaledActions_test_scalar`: On a one-dimensional Q-vector space with ρ(g)=2 and α(g)=2, the rescaled operator is identity.

**Stability of the lattice under the rescaled monoid action** (`CrystallineCM.rescaled_lattice_stable`). For v̄ ∈ S̄ and τ ∈ Hom(F⁺_{v̄},E), the lattice V_{λ̃_τ} is stable under the rescaled action (2.1.7) of O[Δ̃^{Q}_{v̄}].

## Layer CL.1: P-ordinary functors and completed level control

Construct P-ordinary finite-level cohomology using imported ordinary projectors. On smooth O/ϖ^m representations define finite-sum contracting transfer, exact monoid localization in ũ_n alone, and POrd=ord RΓ(U₀,−). Construct completed interior and boundary objects at fixed tame level. Prove that compact Levi derived invariants recover ordinary finite-level cohomology for c≥b≥0,c≥1; increasing c with b fixed is an isomorphism. Extend this control to Q⊂P parahorics without replacing POrd by full QOrd.

**Layer prerequisites:** **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.1**; **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.3**; **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.4**; **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.6**; **CL.0**; **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants:IHG.2**; **PadicFamilies:L0a**; **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.0:abelian-category**; **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.0:derived-extension**; **tauceti:TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology#layer-10-continuous-cohomology-in-all-degrees**.

**P-ordinary part of finite-level cohomology** (`CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFiniteLevel`). Fix S̄ ⊂ S̄_p and good K̃ with fixed tame level and K̃_{v̄} = P_{v̄}(b,c) (c ≥ b ≥ 0, c ≥ 1) for v̄ ∈ S̄, written K̃(b,c), P_{S̄}(b,c) := ∏_{v̄∈S̄} P_{v̄}(b,c). The P-ordinary part RΓ(X̃_{K̃(b,c)}, V_λ̃)^{ord} is the maximal direct summand of RΓ(X̃_{K̃(b,c)}, V_λ̃) on which all Ũ_{ṽ,n} (v̄ ∈ S̄) act invertibly; it is an object of D⁺(P_{S̄}(0,c)/P_{S̄}(b,c), O) with an action of T̃^T ⊗ (⊗_{v̄∈S̄} H(Δ̃_{v̄}, K̃_{v̄})[Ũ^{−1}_{ṽ,n}]); likewise for ∂X̃_{K̃(b,c)}.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFiniteLevel_idempotent`: The finite or adic ordinary projector on the arithmetic complex is idempotent and commutes with the tame Hecke and quotient-group actions.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFiniteLevel_cohomology`: Its cohomology is the maximal summand of H^q on which every chosen Ũ_n acts bijectively.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFiniteLevel_pullback`: Level pullback maps commuting with Ũ_n restrict to the ordinary summands; its inclusion is a natural split map.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFiniteLevel_test_unit`: For U=id the whole arithmetic coefficient complex is ordinary.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFiniteLevel_test_zero`: For U=0 the ordinary summand is zero.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFiniteLevel_test_mixed`: For diag(1,0) on F₃² in degree zero, the ordinary part is the first coordinate, in agreement with Mathlib Fitting range/ker.

Source: CN, §2.2.1, pp.25–26.

Prerequisites: **CL.0**: Parahoric levels P_{v̄}(b,c), Q_{v̄}, the operators Ũ and the monoids Δ̃; **CL.0**: Rescaled actions of the monoids on coefficient lattices; **CL.0**: Stability of the lattice under the rescaled monoid action; **PadicFamilies:L0a** (derived ordinary idempotent); **PadicFamilies:L0a** (ordinary part complexes); **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.1** (finite complex model).

**Unipotent transfer action** (`CrystallineCM.UnipotentTransferAction`). For contracting g∈Δ⁺ and π smooth on Δ⁺⋉U₀, act on Γ(U₀,π) by T_g(v)=Σ_{n∈U₀/gU₀g^{-1}}ngv. This is independent of coset representatives, is integral without averaging denominators, and is multiplicative in g. Derive the same action on RΓ(U₀,π).

At degree zero the formula needs a group U, its coefficient representation ρ, a contraction c:U→U with finite-index image, and an R-linear raw operator A satisfying Aρ(u)=ρ(c(u))A. The arithmetic dictionary is c(u)=gug⁻¹ and A(v)=gv. For v∈V^U, the vector Av is fixed by c(U), so each term ρ(r)Av depends only on the left coset r c(U). Summing over these cosets gives an R-linear endomorphism of Mathlib's `Representation.invariants`. This formulation permits A to be noninvertible and works integrally without a choice of averaging denominators.

For injective contractions c,d, representatives for U/c(U) and U/d(U) combine as a·c(b), giving representatives for U/cd(U). If A and B satisfy the two intertwining equations, this identifies T_c(A)T_d(B) with T_cd(AB); the identity contraction with raw identity operator gives the identity transfer. Surjectivity of c makes the quotient a singleton and gives T_c(A)v=Av. At U=(Z_p,+), c(z)=pz, the quotient is the residue field Z/pZ; on trivial F_p coefficients with A=id, all p summands are equal, so the resulting operator is zero and differs from the raw identity.

The smooth positive-monoid action uses the actual contracting elements and their open finite-index images. The general integral trace is supplied by `TauCeti.DiscreteCoind.traceLinear`, with its arbitrary-transversal identity `TauCeti.DiscreteCoind.trace_eq_sum_transversal`; its finite sum applied to the constant c(U)-invariant vector Av gives the displayed degree-zero formula. These declarations are in Tau Ceti’s current continuous-cohomology library. **ProfiniteCohomology, Layer 10** supplies continuous restriction, conjugation and all-degree corestriction. The construction here composes those maps with the raw contracting action, retaining the compact-unipotent acyclicity and smoothness statements needed for the derived invariants functor. The algebraic degree-zero formula supplies its normalization check.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.UnipotentTransferAction_independent`: Replacing any representative n by an element of its same left coset does not change T_g on U₀-invariants.
- `CrystallineCM.UnipotentTransferAction_mul`: T_{gh}=T_g∘T_h and T_1=id.
- `CrystallineCM.UnipotentTransferAction_compact`: When g normalizes U₀, T_g is the usual g-action because the quotient has one element.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.UnipotentTransferAction_test_trivial_u`: For U₀=1 the transfer action is the original g-action.
- `CrystallineCM.UnipotentTransferAction_test_index_p`: For U₀=Z_p,g contracting by p and trivial F_p coefficients, T_g=p·id=0.
- `CrystallineCM.UnipotentTransferAction_test_not_raw`: In this index-p example raw g=id would incorrectly make it ordinary.

**Ordinary monoid localization** (`CrystallineCM.OrdinaryMonoidLocalization`). For smooth Δ⁺-modules over R_m, ord is the filtered colimit under products of the commuting central operators ũ_n, regarded as a smooth Δ-module. It is exact and preserves the injectives needed to derive compact invariants. Do not replace it by a finite-projector formula for arbitrary smooth infinite modules.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.OrdinaryMonoidLocalization_universal`: Maps from π into a Δ-module extend uniquely through ord π.
- `CrystallineCM.OrdinaryMonoidLocalization_cohomology`: Exact localization satisfies H^j(ord C)=ord H^j(C), with the same operator action.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.OrdinaryMonoidLocalization_test_id`: Localization under U=id is π itself.
- `CrystallineCM.OrdinaryMonoidLocalization_test_nilpotent`: If U^r=0, ord π=0 even when π is infinite-dimensional.
- `CrystallineCM.OrdinaryMonoidLocalization_test_finite`: On a finite module it agrees with the imported finite ordinary projector; for diag(1,0) it is the first coordinate.

**Functors of P-ordinary parts of smooth representations** (`CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFunctors`). For π smooth over R_m=O/ϖ^m on Δ̃^{Q,+}, define POrd(π)=ord RΓ(U₀,π) in D⁺_sm(Δ,R_m), where U₀-invariants carry the finite-sum transfer action and ord localizes only the commuting ũ_n operators. Products over selected places give the global local functor. This is a derived functor with a Δ-action; its degree zero is ord Γ(U₀,π).

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFunctors_degree_zero`: H⁰(POrd π)=ord Γ(U₀,π) for π in degree zero.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFunctors_derived_action`: Each contracting element acts by derived restriction/finite-index transfer, not by its raw representation action.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFunctors_comparison`: For U₀ trivial, POrd π is ordinary monoid localization of π, with no cohomological shift.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFunctors_test_trivial_u`: If U₀=1 it equals the ordinary localization with no shift.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFunctors_test_nilpotent`: A nonzero π with transfer U nilpotent has zero POrd; merely taking U₀-invariants gives the wrong functor.
- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryFunctors_test_degree_zero`: For π in degree zero H⁰ is ord Γ(U₀,π), while positive cohomology is retained when ordinary transfer permits it.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.POrdinaryCompleted_boundary`: Restriction to boundary intertwines the two completed POrd objects and the finite-level recovery maps.

Acceptance tests:

**P-ordinary parts at parahoric level Q** (`CrystallineCM.ParahoricVariant`). For standard Q_{v̄}⊂P_{v̄}, with 𝒬_{v̄} its integral parahoric and K_{v̄}=𝒬_{v̄}∩G(F⁺_{v̄}), define the parahoric P-ordinary invariant functor π↦RΓ(K_{S̄},ord RΓ(U₀_{S̄},π)). It takes values in D⁺(K_{S̄}[ũ_n^{±1}]/K_{S̄},O/ϖ^m) with H(Δ^{Q_{S̄}},K_{S̄}) action. Here ord inverts ũ_n alone; it does not invert every Q-partial Hecke operator.

## Layer CL.3: Bruhat induction and deep unipotent cohomology

Compare algebraic relative Bruhat closure with the local p-adic topology. Construct unnormalized induction on open length unions, individual strata and open cells, with exact extension/restriction filtration. Prove the cohomological short exact sequences and ordinary open/identity-cell subquotients, retaining the inverse determinant unit character χ and rank shift. In the abelian Siegel case split RΓ(U₀,O/ϖ^m) after sufficiently deep Levi restriction, at arbitrary p. Use the pinned Artin–Rees results to lift finite-module subquotients after increasing the coefficient exponent.

**Parabolic Bruhat decomposition and closure relations** (`CrystallineCM.relative_bruhat_local_closure`). Let L be a p-adic field and G/O_L split connected reductive with split maximal torus T ⊂ B ⊂ P = M ⋉ U; W^P ⊂ W the minimal length representatives of W_P\W and ^PW^P := W^P ∩ (W^P)^{−1}. Then G(L) = ⊔_{w∈^PW^P} P(L)wP(L); the closure of P(L)wP(L) (p-adic topology) is ⊔_{w′≤w} P(L)w′P(L) for the Bruhat order; and P(L)ΩP(L) is open for every upper subset Ω ⊂ ^PW^P.

**The modulus-type character χ of M(L)** (`CrystallineCM.ChiCharacter`). χ : M(L) → O^× is χ(m) = Nm_{L/Q_p} det_L(Ad(m)|_{Lie U(L)})^{−1} / |Nm_{L/Q_p} det_L(Ad(m)|_{Lie U(L)})|_p.

Write δ(m)=Nm_{L/Q_p}det_L(Ad(m)|_{Lie U(L)}) and v_p for the integer valuation on a nonzero p-adic number. The formula is equivalently χ(m)=δ(m)^{-1}p^{v_p(δ(m))}, where the rational value of the absolute value is embedded into Q_p before division. This gives a unit of Z_p and then a unit of O through the coefficient map. Reuse Mathlib's `PadicInt.mkUnits` to package the valuation-zero value. If δ(m) is already a p-adic unit, the formula gives precisely its inverse. The norm-determinant character and its interpretation on top continuous cohomology are supplied by the specified Lie-action and orientation interfaces. Normalizing an arbitrary supplied character does not establish that interpretation.


Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.ChiCharacter_mul`: χ(mm′)=χ(m)χ(m′) and χ(1)=1.
- `CrystallineCM.ChiCharacter_unit_value`: The normalization has p-adic valuation zero and therefore lies in Z_p×⊂O×.
- `CrystallineCM.ChiCharacter_orientation`: Its restriction to compact Levi is the inverse determinant on top continuous unipotent cohomology; on the torus it agrees with the appropriate PA.2 orientation character.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.ChiCharacter_test_identity`: χ(1)=1.
- `CrystallineCM.ChiCharacter_test_rank_one_unit`: For GL₂ and m=diag(a,d) with a/d∈Z_p×, χ(m)=d/a.
- `CrystallineCM.ChiCharacter_test_uniformizer`: For L=Q_p and m=diag(p,1), χ(m)=1 because the determinant inverse and absolute-value denominator cancel.

For G split reductive over O_L, K = G(O_L), K_P = K ∩ P(L), and X a compact Hausdorff space with a continuous P(L)-action on which K_P acts freely: X ×^P G (the quotient of X × G(L) by (x,g)·p = (xp, p^{−1}g)) is K-equivariantly homeomorphic to X ×^{K_P} K, and there is a natural isomorphism RΓ(X ×^P G, O/ϖ^m) ≅ Ind^{G(L)}_{P(L)} RΓ(X, O/ϖ^m) in D⁺_sm(G(L), O/ϖ^m).

For every m ≥ 1 there is M = M(m) ≥ m such that RΓ(U₀, O/ϖ^m) ≅ ⊕_{i=0}^{rk_{Z_p}U₀} H^i(U₀, O/ϖ^m)[−i] in D⁺_sm(K_M, O/ϖ^m); each H^i(U₀, O/ϖ^m) is non-zero, with trivial K_M-action. Cohomology is Hom_cts(∧^i_{Z_p}U₀,O/ϖ^m), not ∧^i U₀. No condition p>n² is imposed. The source argument is not exported to arbitrary nonabelian unipotent radicals.

This is unnormalized induction on the open Bruhat union. I_{≥0} is Res_P Ind_P^{G̃}. The individual stratum and open-cell functors are separate declarations.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.InductionFiltrationFunctors_zero`: I_{≥0}(π)=Res_P Ind_P^{G̃}(π) in unnormalized conventions.
- `CrystallineCM.InductionFiltrationFunctors_inclusion`: Extension by zero gives I_{≥i+1}(π)→I_{≥i}(π).
- `CrystallineCM.InductionFiltrationFunctors_restriction`: Restriction to length-i strata gives I_{≥i}(π)→⊕_{ℓ(w)=i}I_w(π).

Acceptance tests:

For w∈^PW^P, I_w(π) consists of locally constant functions f:P(L)wP(L)→π compactly supported modulo left P(L), with f(pg)=pf(g); right P(L) acts by translation. It is one summand of the length-ℓ(w) quotient I_{≥ℓ(w)}/I_{≥ℓ(w)+1}, whose full quotient is the sum over all strata of that length; it retains the local topology.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.BruhatStratumInduction_equivariance`: Each f satisfies f(pg)=pf(g) on its stratum.
- `CrystallineCM.BruhatStratumInduction_translation`: Right translation gives the P(L)-action and is compatible with compact-mod-P support.
- `CrystallineCM.BruhatStratumInduction_restriction`: The length-i quotient of I_{≥i} restricts to the direct sum of the I_w with ℓ(w)=i.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.BruhatOpenCellInduction_extend_zero`: Extension by zero gives an injective M⁺⋉U₀-equivariant map I°_w→I_w.

- `CrystallineCM.BruhatOpenCellInduction_evaluate`: At w₀^P, evaluation on U₀-invariants gives the coefficient module with the w₀^P-conjugated Levi action.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.BruhatOpenCellInduction_test_identity`: S°_1=P(L), so I°_1=I_1.
- `CrystallineCM.BruhatOpenCellInduction_test_w0_eval`: At w₀^P the evaluated Levi action is conjugated by block exchange, rather than the original action.
- `CrystallineCM.BruhatOpenCellInduction_test_nonopen_support`: For nonzero trivial coefficients on the longest cell, a nonzero locally constant function with compact support in a compact-open neighborhood in left P(L)-quotient of S_w outside left P(L)-quotient of S°_w is not in I°_w. Single-point support is not assumed to be locally constant.

Then: (1) r_ι(π)|_{G_{F_v}} is conjugate to a block upper-triangular representation with diagonal blocks r_j(π) : G_{F_v} → GL_{n_j}(Q̄_p) (j = 1,…,t), each crystalline (3.1.1); (2) the Q_{v̄}-ordinary subspace of ι^{−1}π^{𝒬}_{v̄} is one-dimensional; (3) the τ-Hodge–Tate weights of the r_j(π) are obtained by decomposing λ̃_{τ,2n} < λ̃_{τ,2n−1} + 1 < … < λ̃_{τ,1} + 2n − 1 according to (n₁,…,n_t); (4) ∏_{j=1}^k det r_j(π)(Art_{F_v}(u)) = ∏_{i=1}^{n₁+…+n_k} ∏_{τ:F_v↪Q̄_p} τ(u)^{−λ̃_{τ,2n−i+1}−i+1} for u ∈ O^×_{F_v}, and ∏_{j=1}^k det r_j(π)(Art_{F_v}(ϖ_v)) equals ε_p^{Σ_{i=1}^{n₁+…+n_k}(1−i)}(Art_{F_v}(ϖ_v)) times the eigenvalue of Ũ^k_v on the Q_{v̄}-ordinary subspace.

## Layer CL.5: The localized completed Siegel boundary

Construct the equivariant unipotent coefficient object V_U=RΓ(U₀,V/ϖ^m) and its homotopy inverse limit; retain the vanishing bound and the exact nonzero range for trivial selected weights. Identify the localized completed Siegel boundary with induced Levi cohomology, using non-Eisenstein boundary-stratum elimination, topological induction and unipotent descent. Prove the Hecke-equivariant completed boundary summand and its integral coefficient-evaluation retract, with zero weights on the complementary p-places.

**The coefficient object V_U(λ̃_S̄, m) on the Levi locally symmetric spaces** (`CrystallineCM.BoundaryCoefficientObject`). For S̄⊆S̄_p, dominant λ̃, R_m=O/ϖ^m, put V_{λ̃_S̄}=⊗_{v̄∈S̄,τ}V_{λ̃_τ}. V_U(λ̃_S̄,m) is the equivariant locally constant derived coefficient object on the GL_n adelic tower corresponding to RΓ(U₀_{S̄},V_{λ̃_S̄}/ϖ^m), descended to good X_K through the genuine Levi conjugation action. Its cohomology sheaves vanish outside [0,r], r=n²Σ_{v̄∈S̄}[F⁺_{v̄}:Q_p]. If λ̃_S̄=0, every degree 0,…,r is nonzero and H^j=Hom_cts(∧^j_{Z_p}U₀_{S̄},R_m). Define V_U(λ̃_S̄)=holim_m V_U(λ̃_S̄,m). The exact nonzero range is required for zero selected weights; the general-weight assertion here is the cohomological-dimension bound.

- `CrystallineCM.BoundaryCoefficientObject_amplitude`: Its cohomology sheaves vanish outside [0,n²Σ_{v̄∈S̄}[F⁺_{v̄}:Q_p]]; exact nonvanishing across this range is asserted here only for zero λ̃ on S̄.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.BoundaryCoefficientObject_test_empty_places`: For S̄=∅, V_U is the original coefficient in degree zero with no unipotent shift.
- `CrystallineCM.BoundaryCoefficientObject_test_zero_weight_rank_one`: For n=1,L=Q_p and zero coefficients, H⁰ and H¹ are R_m, all other groups vanish; the Levi action on H¹ is the inverse adjoint character.
- `CrystallineCM.BoundaryCoefficientObject_test_exterior_dual`: For zero coefficients, the fibers agree with PA.0/unipotent-exterior-cohomology as continuous Hom of exterior powers, not the exterior power of U₀ itself.

## Layer CL.6: Degree shifting and nilpotent Hecke comparisons

Construct ordinary twisted/dual Satake diagrams and the integral, torsion and unitary middle-degree Hecke images; define the two deep congruence level families. Under ambient decomposed genericity compare middle-degree unitary and Levi derived-coefficient images and their duals. If the complementary local degree sum is at least half [F⁺:Q], prove d−q≤n² times that sum for q≥floor(d/2). Produce the torsion degree-shifting squares modulo nilpotent ideals J with J^N=0, N depending only on n,[F⁺:Q], while the depth and exponent m′ may increase.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.OrdHeckeAlgebras42_local_factor`: The untwisted GL_n factor is H(Δ^Q,K_Q); the unitary factor localizes H(Δ̃^Q,𝒬) only at Ũ_n.
- `CrystallineCM.OrdHeckeAlgebras42_twisted_satake`: S^{w₀^P} sends Ũ_n to U_ṽ and Ũ_{2n} to U_ṽ U_{ṽc}^{−1}.
- `CrystallineCM.OrdHeckeAlgebras42_dual_satake`: S^ι sends inverse local cosets to inverse Levi cosets, with no additional w₀^P-conjugation in its untwisted target.

Acceptance tests:

Source: CN, Lemma 4.2.5, p.62.

Prerequisites: the standing dimension conventions and elementary integer arithmetic.

**Deep Levi congruence level** (`CrystallineCM.DeepLeviLevel`). For e≥1 and S̄⊂S̄_p, K(e,S̄)_v=K_v∩ker(GL_n(O_{F_v})→GL_n(O_{F_v}/ϖ_v^e)) for v above S̄, and K_v elsewhere. The same depth is imposed at both conjugate places. K(e′,S̄)⊂K(e,S̄) for e′≥e.

The subgroup construction only needs the given level K and its integral component
homomorphisms K→GL_n(O_{F_v}). These homomorphisms are defined on K: an arbitrary
element of the ambient adelic group need not be integral. Intersect the inverse
images of the reduction kernels inside K, then map this subgroup into the ambient
group by K's inclusion. Selection is by the map v↦v̄ followed by membership in S̄,
so it imposes the same depth at both conjugate places. The quotient map and its
matrix-group homomorphism are Mathlib's `Ideal.Quotient.mk` and
`Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.map`; the construction uses their actual kernels.

For the rank-one test, the two conjugate components over Z_p belong exactly when
each has the form 1+p^e a. The local-uniformizer test can be stated in an integral
local domain of characteristic zero with a nonzero element π in the maximal ideal
and π²=p: the unit 1+π is congruent to 1 modulo π and fails congruence modulo p.
Cancellation would otherwise put 1 in the ideal generated by π. This gives a
specific ramified instance of the normalization test without changing the local
integer ring or replacing π by the coefficient uniformizer.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.DeepLeviLevel_mem`: g∈K(e,S̄) iff g∈K and every selected p-component is identity modulo its local ϖ_v^e.
- `CrystallineCM.DeepLeviLevel_antitone`: e′≥e implies K(e′,S̄)⊂K(e,S̄).
- `CrystallineCM.DeepLeviLevel_empty`: K(e,∅)=K.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.DeepLeviLevel_test_empty`: S̄=∅ leaves K unchanged.
- `CrystallineCM.DeepLeviLevel_test_scalar`: For GL₁ over Z_p with K=Z_p×, K(e,{v̄})=1+p^e Z_p at each conjugate place.
- `CrystallineCM.DeepLeviLevel_test_local_uniformizer`: At ramified F_v/Q_p, congruence modulo ϖ_v^e differs from congruence modulo p^e; the local uniformizer is required.

Source: CN, §4.2.1, p.61.

Prerequisites: **CL.0**: Parahoric levels P_{v̄}(b,c), Q_{v̄}, the operators Ũ and the monoids Δ̃; **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.0** (standard level subgroups).

**Deep unitary congruence level** (`CrystallineCM.DeepUnitaryLevel`). K̃(e,S̄)_{v̄}=K̃_{v̄}∩P_{v̄}(e,e) for v̄∈S̄ and K̃_{v̄} elsewhere; equivalently the reduction modulo ϖ_ṽ^e is block unipotent (1_n *;0 1_n), so U₀ remains present. This is deeper than diagonal-level control while retaining the unipotent fiber.

Use the split-place integral component maps on K̃ to pull back the CL.0 subgroup
P(e,e), intersect inside K̃, and include the resulting subgroup in the ambient
unitary adelic group. Membership imposes identity on the two diagonal blocks and
zero on the lower-left block modulo the local uniformizer power; the upper-right
block is unrestricted. Any element of K̃ whose selected components are exactly
upper block unipotent belongs at every depth. This supplies the inclusion of U₀
once the original level contains U₀. In rank two, the upper unipotent matrix with
upper-right entry 1 lies in this subgroup even when reduction is exact, while
principal congruence would exclude it. Over F₃ at depth one with zero reduction
ideal, this distinction is already visible.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.DeepUnitaryLevel_mem`: A selected component lies in K̃(e,S̄) iff it lies in the original K̃ and its diagonal blocks reduce to identity and its lower-left block to zero modulo ϖ_ṽ^e.
- `CrystallineCM.DeepUnitaryLevel_unipotent`: U(O_{F⁺_{v̄}})⊂K̃(e,S̄) whenever it was contained in K̃.
- `CrystallineCM.DeepUnitaryLevel_empty`: K̃(e,∅)=K̃.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.DeepUnitaryLevel_test_empty`: S̄=∅ leaves K̃ unchanged.
- `CrystallineCM.DeepUnitaryLevel_test_upper_unipotent`: For n=1, (1 1;0 1) belongs at every depth when in K̃.
- `CrystallineCM.DeepUnitaryLevel_test_not_principal`: The same upper-unipotent matrix need not be identity modulo ϖ^e, so replacing this level by a principal congruence subgroup destroys U₀.

**Degree shifting to middle-degree P-ordinary cohomology of G̃** (`CrystallineCM.middle_degree_hecke_comparison`). Let K̃ be good, decomposed with respect to P, K̃_{U,v̄} = U⁰_{v̄} for v̄ ∈ S̄_p; m ⊂ T^T non-Eisenstein, m̃ = 𝒮^*(m) with ρ̄_{m̃} decomposed generic; S̄_p = S̄₁ ⊔ S̄₂ ⊔ S̄₃ with standard parabolics Q_{v̄} ⊂ P_{v̄} for v̄ ∈ S̄₃; λ̃, λ dominant with (1) λ̃_τ = (−w_{0,n}λ_{τ̃c}, λ_τ̃) for τ inducing v̄ ∈ S̄₁, (2) λ̃_τ = 0 for v̄ ∈ S̄₂, (3) K̃_{v̄} = 𝒬_{v̄} and λ̃_τ = (−w_{0,n}λ_{τ̃c}, λ_τ̃) for v̄ ∈ S̄₃. Then 𝒮^{w₀^P} descends to a homomorphism T̃^{Q_{S̄₃},S̄₃-ord}(H^d(X̃_{K̃}, V_λ̃)^{ord}_{m̃}) → T^{Q_{S̄₃},S̄₃-ord}_{w₀^P}(H^d(X_{K^{S̄₃}K^{w₀^P}_{S̄₃}}, V_{λ_{S̄₁}} ⊗ V_U(λ̃_{S̄₂}) ⊗ V_{λ_{S̄₃}})_m) (H^d degree-d hypercohomology), and T̃^{…}(H^d(X̃_{K̃}, V_λ̃)^{ord}_{m̃}) ↪ T̃^{…}(H^d(X̃_{K̃}, V_λ̃[1/p])^{ord}_{m̃}).

**Hecke images A(K,λ,q), A(K,λ,q,m), Ã(K̃,λ̃,S̄) and deep levels** (`CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesA`). A(K,λ,q)=T^{Q^{w₀^P},S̄-ord}_{w₀^P}(H^q(X_K,V_λ)_m), the image subalgebra of the displayed actual cohomological Hecke action. All source notations m, Q and the chosen ordinary localization are fixed; it is not the whole abstract Hecke algebra.

For the actual action a:H→End_O(M), the defining image has a surjective map H→im(a) and an injective tautological map im(a)→End_O(M). A homomorphism f:H→B factors uniquely through im(a) exactly when a(h)=0 implies f(h)=0 for every h∈H. Extending scalars sends a(h) to 1⊗a(h) on E⊗_O M; reuse `Module.End.baseChangeHom` for this algebra map. The induced map between the two images is injective when the canonical map M→E⊗_O M is injective. The application must identify rational cohomology with this scalar extension and supply the stated middle-degree injection. No such injectivity follows from the definition of an image algebra alone.


Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesA_factor`: A map out of the abstract algebra factors through A iff it kills the annihilator of the displayed localized cohomology.
- `CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesA_integral_to_rational`: The map to its rational cohomology image is induced by tensoring the actual coefficient complex; injectivity requires the specified middle-degree input and is not unconditional for GL_n.

Acceptance tests:

**Degree shifting with dual coefficients** (`CrystallineCM.dual_middle_degree_hecke_comparison`). Assumptions as in Degree shifting to middle-degree P-ordinary cohomology of G̃ (CL.6) except: ρ̄_{𝒮^*(m^∨)} decomposed generic, and λ̃_τ = (λ_τ̃, −w_{0,n}λ_{τ̃c}) for τ inducing places of S̄₁ and S̄₃ (λ̃_τ = 0 on S̄₂, K̃_{v̄} = 𝒬_{v̄} on S̄₃). Then 𝒮^ι descends to T̃^{Q_{S̄₃},S̄₃-ord,ι̃}(H^d(X̃_{K̃}, V^∨_λ̃)^{ord∨}_{𝒮^*(m^∨)}) → T^{Q_{S̄₃},S̄₃-ord,ι}(H^d(X_K, V^∨_{λ_{S̄₁}} ⊗ V_U(λ̃_{S̄₂}) ⊗ V^∨_{λ_{S̄₃}})_{m^∨}); T̃^{…}(H^d(X̃,V^∨)^{ord∨}) ↪ T̃^{…}(H^d(X̃,V^∨[1/p])^{ord∨}), and by Poincaré duality the rational unitary algebra on the right of this injection is isomorphic to T̃^{Q_{S̄₃},S̄₃-ord}(H^d(X̃_{K̃}, V_λ̃[1/p])^{ord}_{ι̃^*𝒮^*(m^∨)}). Here ρ̄_{ι̃^*𝒮^*(m^∨)} = ρ̄_m(−n) ⊕ ρ̄_m^{∨,c}(1−n).

Prerequisites: **CL.6**: Degree shifting to middle-degree P-ordinary cohomology of G̃; **CL.6**: The dual Levi coefficient module is a summand of the dual U-cohomology; **CL.3**: Dual version: ordinary part for the opposite parabolic; **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.5:finite-level-duality** (verdier poincare duality).

**Dual Hecke images A^∨ and Ã^∨** (`CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesDual`). For S̄_p = S̄₁ ∪ S̄₂ ∪ S̄₃: A^∨(K,λ,q) := T^{Q_{S̄₃},S̄₃-ord,ι}(H^q(X_K, V^∨_λ)_{m^∨}), A^∨(K,λ,q,m) the same with V^∨_λ/ϖ^m, Ã^∨(K̃,λ̃,S̄₃) := T̃^{Q_{S̄₃},S̄₃-ord,ι̃}(H^d(X̃_{K̃}, V^∨_λ̃)^{ord∨}_{𝒮^*m^∨}).

Construct each image from its actual dual-coefficient cohomology module and action, retaining the coefficient ring and localization. Coefficient duality takes place before cohomology. Over O, the module H^q(V^∨) cannot in general be replaced by Hom_O(H^q(V),O); duality can change the degree, supports and torsion terms. For example, Hom_ℤ(ℤ/3,ℤ)=0 although ℤ/3 is nonzero. The source's rational middle-degree Poincaré comparison supplies the particular perfect pairing used to compare the two image algebras.

The algebraic descent of adjointness is explicit. Let H act on M and N by a and b, let ι be an involutive R-algebra automorphism of H, and let N≃Hom_R(M,R) be a perfect pairing that separates points of M. If ⟨a(h)x,y⟩=⟨x,b(ι(h))y⟩, then a(h)=0 exactly when b(ι(h))=0. This gives an isomorphism im(a)≃im(b) carrying a(h) to b(ι(h)). Apply it to the arithmetic pairing with its specified degree and support comparison; do not assert an integral pairing merely from the existence of a rational one. Mathlib's `Representation.dual` supplies the coefficient formula ρ^∨(g)φ=φ∘ρ(g⁻¹), and `Module.Dual.eval` supplies the comparison with the double dual without an unconditional reflexivity assertion.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesDual_coefficient`: A^∨ uses the inverse-coset action on H^q(X_K,V_λ^∨)_{m^∨}, with the integral and mod-ϖ^m variants distinguished.

- `CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesDual_unitary`: Ã^∨ is the image on unitary middle-degree dual POrd, localized at S^*(m^∨).

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesDual_test_zero_cohomology`: All dual Hecke images vanish on the zero module.
- `CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesDual_test_scalar_inverse`: A double-coset operator acting by a unit a on a perfect dual pair acts adjointly through its inverse coset, so the relevant scalar is a^{-1} when the group action is one-dimensional.
- `CrystallineCM.HeckeImagesDual_test_involution`: Applying the coefficient dual and Hecke inversion twice recovers the original action and maximal ideal.

**Torsion Hecke image** (`CrystallineCM.TorsionHeckeImage`). A(K,λ,q,m)=image of T^{Q^{w₀^P},S̄-ord}_{w₀^P} in End_O(H^q(X_K,V_λ/ϖ^m)_m). Integral and torsion Hecke operators agree on the image of integral cohomology in torsion cohomology. A map A(K,λ,q)/ϖ^m→A(K,λ,q,m) requires an additional annihilator containment; neither that map nor equality is automatic.

- `CrystallineCM.TorsionHeckeImage_faithful`: Its tautological action on this module is injective as a map of algebras.
- `CrystallineCM.TorsionHeckeImage_image_reduction`: An integral Hecke operator and its induced torsion operator agree on the image of H^q(V_λ)→H^q(V_λ/ϖ^m).

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.TorsionHeckeImage_test_zero`: Zero torsion cohomology gives the zero image algebra.
- `CrystallineCM.TorsionHeckeImage_test_scalar_mod`: For a scalar O-action on R_m, its torsion image is R_m.
- `CrystallineCM.TorsionHeckeImage_test_new_torsion`: Torsion H^{q+1}(V) may contribute to H^q(V/ϖ^m); the definition cannot identify the latter image with A(K,λ,q)/ϖ^m without extra hypotheses.

A concrete instance is the two-term complex O --ϖ--> O in degrees zero and one for a nonzero uniformizer in a DVR. Its integral H⁰ is zero and its H¹ is O/ϖ. After derived reduction modulo ϖ the differential is zero, so H⁰ becomes O/ϖ. Thus its scalar Hecke image in degree zero changes from zero to O/ϖ. There can be no unital map from that zero integral image to the nonzero torsion image. Equivariance of the coefficient map still compares operators on the image of integral H⁰, which is zero here; it does not identify the whole torsion cohomology with a reduction of integral H⁰.

**Unitary middle-degree Hecke image** (`CrystallineCM.UnitaryMiddleHeckeImage`). Ã(K̃,λ̃,S̄)=image of T̃^{Q^{w₀^P},S̄-ord} in End_O(H^d(X̃_{K̃},V_λ̃)^{P-ord}_{m̃}). Under the generic middle-degree injection this is a finite torsion-free O-algebra inside its rational image. Q-unit eigensystems are selected by the maximal ideal, not by redefining POrd.

Use the actual middle-degree action a:H→End_O(M) and its image, as for A. Tensoring M with E gives the image homomorphism into the rational action. Its injectivity follows from the supplied middle-degree injection M→E⊗_O M; it is not a property of every integral Hecke image. In particular, if r∈O has nonzero image in E and r annihilates an image endomorphism, that endomorphism is zero. Finiteness comes from the arithmetic middle-degree module, separately from this range argument.

Evaluate a character χ on the image of every rescaled partial block operator through H→im(a)→E. Equal Siegel values alone do not determine this character: in the faithful regular action of ℚ×ℚ on itself, the two projection characters both send (1,1) to 1 but send (1,2) to 1 and 2. All those displayed eigenvalues are units. The cuspidal realization of the character uses the CTG and all-partial-unit hypotheses of Proposition 4.2.11, p.67, as specified in CL.7.

## Layer CL.7: Crystalline local–global compatibility

For all-unit Q-localized non-Eisenstein torsion Hecke systems, produce local finite-flat characteristic-zero lifts with crystalline blocks, labelled weights and determinant characters. Use CTG perturbation and a separating character twist, then import compatible local reconstruction. Assemble a global Hecke-valued representation modulo a uniformly nilpotent ideal factoring through crystalline/semistable-ordinary local deformation rings in the three specified partitions. Export fixed-determinant compatibility for p∤n and crystallinity of unramified characteristic-zero GL_n representations under residual irreducibility and decomposed genericity. Reconstruction over torsion Hecke targets requires the explicit IHG.1 extension; its flat-target export alone is insufficient. In the char-zero endpoint, choose a cyclic CM extension where the selected p-places split completely, so their local fields are unchanged.

If the semisimplified residual reduction r̄_ι(π) is irreducible and decomposed generic, then r_ι(π)|_{G_{F_v}} and r_ι(π)|_{G_{F_{v^c}}} are crystalline with τ-labelled Hodge–Tate weights λ_{ιτ,n} < … < λ_{ιτ,1} + n − 1 for τ inducing v or v^c respectively.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: For this characteristic-zero theorem F is totally real or CM (the imaginary-quadratic subfield condition is dropped); F⁺ is F in the totally real case, n≥2, p a prime; all places of F⁺ above p split in F when unitary parahorics are used. The coefficient field E/Q_p is finite and contains all relevant embeddings, O is its integer ring, k its residue field, and ϖ its uniformizer. Local uniformizers ϖ_v are distinct notation.

## Layer CL.8: Two-component patching and PGL₂ cohomology

Package common-residual perfect complexes, finite derived Hecke images modulo nilpotents, equidimensional local rings and unique generic generalizations. Prove two-system automorphic component propagation and pointwise augmentation support. Import exact BT and semistable-ordinary local component results from LocalGaloisDeformationRings. Construct non-neat PGL₂ equivariant cohomology by homotopy limits, identify it with the AKT complex, and obtain its finite Hecke Galois representation; under p odd, ζ_p∈F and trivial residual coefficients, prove localized vanishing and perfectness.

Let T∞⊂End_D(S∞)(C∞) and T′∞⊂End_D(S∞)(C′∞) be finite S∞-algebras whose images coincide in the endomorphism algebra of that residual complex. Let R∞,R′∞ be complete Noetherian local S∞-algebras surjecting onto T∞/I∞,T′∞/I′∞ for nilpotent ideals, and identify R∞/ϖ≅R′∞/ϖ compatibly with S∞ and the actions on the common residual cohomology modulo Ī∞+Ī′∞. Choose q₀∈Z,l₀≥0. Assume dim R∞=dim R′∞=dim S∞−l₀, dim(R∞/ϖ)=dim(R′∞/ϖ)=dim S∞−l₀−1; both R-spectra are equidimensional with characteristic-zero generic points; each special generic point has a unique generic generalization in each R-spectrum. The augmentation fiber C∞⊗ᴸS∞/a∞ has nonzero rational cohomology concentrated in [q₀,q₀+l₀]. Fix a characteristic-zero prime x of T∞/a∞T∞. Support is defined through the finite Hecke action modulo nilpotents; no honest R∞-module chain model is postulated.

Required API:

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.TwoSystemPatchingData_test_same_system`: If both systems and residual identifications coincide, the relation pairs a component with itself and propagation preserves its existing support.
- `CrystallineCM.TwoSystemPatchingData_test_crossing_reject`: For R=O[[x,y]]/(xy−ϖ²), the special generic points are (ϖ,x) and (ϖ,y), while (ϖ,x,y) is a closed intersection point. The latter cannot be used as a special generic point in the specialization relation, even though it lies on both special components.
- `CrystallineCM.TwoSystemPatchingData_test_nilpotents`: Replacing an action by a larger nilpotent quotient does not change its closed support, matching the IHG ghost/maximal-ideal interface.

## Layer CL.9: Barsotti–Tate automorphy lifting and solvable descent

State the fifteen prepared CM lifting hypotheses, define fixed-determinant χ-type and Taylor–Wiles deformation problems, and construct deformation-to-derived-Hecke surjections and diamond-compatible perfect complexes. Use AKT small-image Taylor–Wiles prime selection with its p=5 exception, check q₀=l₀=[F⁺:Q] and patch the two coefficient systems to prove prepared BT lifting. Prove solvable preparation and descent preserving the full residual/cyclotomic field. Export potentially BT automorphy under the original hypotheses plus d_cyc≠3 or projective residual image not A₄; retain the cubic-tetrahedral limitation of the finite-image argument. Construct the prepared PGL₂ level with pro-v Iwahori auxiliary components, choose the three unitary parabolic branches and the residual ordinary Hecke ideal. The non-enormous AKT Selmer-detection and CM relative generator-count inputs belong to GlobalGaloisDeformations:R04.5.

**The data and hypotheses (1)–(15) of the special case of Theorem 5.2** (`CrystallineCM.Setup56`). Data: F imaginary CM, p odd, ι : Q̄_p ≅ C; S ⊇ S_p finite; R ⊂ S prime to p and S_p = S^cr_p ⊔ S^st_p; π cuspidal on PGL₂(𝔸_F), regular algebraic of weight 0. Hypotheses: (5) every prime below S or ramified in F splits in an imaginary quadratic subfield of F (so S is split over F⁺ and F/F⁺ unramified); (6) for v ∈ S_p there is a p-adic v′ ≠ v̄ of F⁺ with Σ_{v″≠v̄,v′}[F⁺_{v″} : Q_p] > ½[F⁺ : Q], and the residue field of v̄ is bigger than F_p; (7) π_v unramified for v ∉ R ∪ S^st_p; (8) π^{Iw_v}_v ≠ 0 for v ∈ R ∪ S^st_p; (9) for v ∈ S^st_p, π is ι-ordinary of weight 0 at v and r_ι(π)|_{G_{F_v}} is non-crystalline ordinary; (10) ζ_p ∈ F if S = S_p ∪ R; (11) otherwise S − (S_p ∪ R) contains two places of distinct residue characteristics; (12) v ∉ R^c and H²(F_v, ad⁰r̄) = 0 for v ∈ S − (R ∪ S_p); (13) r̄_{π,ι} decomposed generic with r̄|_{G_{F(ζ_p)}} irreducible; (14) r̄_{π,ι}|_{G_{F_v}} trivial for v ∈ S_p ∪ R; (15) if p=5 and the projective image of r̄_{π,ι}(G_{F(ζ₅)}) is conjugate to PSL₂(F₅), the extension of F cut out by the projective image of r̄_{π,ι} does not contain ζ₅.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.Setup56_local_branch`: The data remembers the partition S_p^{cr} ⊔ S_p^{st}. PreparedPGL2Level chooses the unitary split-place orientation and its corresponding parabolics.
- `CrystallineCM.Setup56_auxiliary`: It remembers either ζ_p∈F with S=S_p∪R, or two auxiliary places of distinct residue characteristics satisfying H²(ad⁰r̄)=0.
- `CrystallineCM.Setup56_residual`: The residual representation is decomposed generic, irreducible on G_{F(ζ_p)}, locally trivial at S_p∪R, with the exact p=5 exceptional-field condition.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.Setup56_test_weak_degree`: A complementary degree sum equal to half violates the strict >½ condition in this prepared setup, although it suffices for Theorem 4.2.15.
- `CrystallineCM.Setup56_test_two_auxiliary`: Two auxiliary places of the same residue characteristic violate condition (11).
- `CrystallineCM.Setup56_test_small_residue`: A p-place with residue field F_p violates condition (6), even if the residual representation there is trivial.

**A reducibility criterion for mod-p representations (variant of DDT 4.11)** (`CrystallineCM.determinant_kernel_reducible_except_tetrahedral`). Let G be finite, p odd, ρ : G → GL₂(F̄_p) with det ρ of order d > 1, and suppose (tr ρ(g))² = (1 + det ρ(g))² whenever det ρ(g) ≠ 1. Then ρ|_{ker(det ρ)} is reducible, unless d = 3 and the projective image of ρ is A₄; in that case ρ|_{ker(det ρ)} has projective image Z/2 × Z/2 and is absolutely irreducible.

Reducibility here means that the determinant kernel fixes a one-dimensional subspace of the two-dimensional vector space over the algebraically closed coefficient field. Realize the projective image as the range of conjugation by ρ on the ambient GL₂: the kernel of conjugation on GL₂ is exactly its scalar subgroup. Quotienting by the centre of ρ(G) would instead remove every element of an abelian image, including nonscalar projective elements, and would change the criterion. In the exceptional branch, the determinant image has order three, the projective image is A₄, the determinant kernel has projective image (Z/2)², and it fixes no line. The non-exceptional branch supplies a fixed line without assuming that ρ itself is irreducible.

**Taylor–Wiles data for GL₂ over CM fields without enormous image (Allen–Khare–Thorne)** (`CrystallineCM.small_image_taylor_wiles_prime_selection`). Let F be an imaginary CM field, p odd, and ρ̄ : G_F → GL₂(k) continuous with ρ̄|_{G_{F(ζ_p)}} absolutely irreducible and, if p = 5 and the projective image of ρ̄(G_{F(ζ₅)}) is PSL₂(F₅), the field cut out by the projective image of ρ̄ not containing ζ₅. Then for every N ≥ 1 there is a Taylor–Wiles datum (Q_N, (α_v)_{v∈Q_N}) of level N (Definition 5.3.5) of size q independent of N, killing the relevant dual Selmer group ([AKT23, Prop. A.6]), used with [ACC+18, §6.4] as in the proof of [AKT23, Thm. A.7]. Fix T=S, choose q≥dim_k H¹_{S⊥,S}(ad⁰ρ̄(1)) with g=q−3[F⁺:Q]−1+|S|≥0; then there is a surjection A_S^S[[X₁,…,X_g]]→R_{S_{Q_N}}^S, and the places can have degree one over Q with underlying rational primes split in the chosen imaginary quadratic subfield. The local deformation datum is that of AKT Appendix A.2. The standing local deformation datum is AKT A.2: determinant lifting detρ̄, specified local deformation quotients R_v over Λ_v, Λ=completed tensor of Λ_v, nonempty S⊇S_p, and the finite coefficient field large enough for all residual eigenvalues. Choose F₀ as the CM subfield appearing in A.6 and require F=F⁺F₀.

**Prepared PGL₂ level and unitary parabolic branches** (`CrystallineCM.PreparedPGL2Level`).

In the auxiliary-place case K is neat; otherwise ζ_p∈F and localized perfectness uses Proposition 5.5.3. Put T=S∪S^c. For every v̄|p choose ṽ|v̄ in S_p^{st} whenever that set meets {ṽ,ṽ^c}. The unitary parabolic Q_{v̄} has partition (2,1,1) if ṽ is st and ṽ^c is cr, (1,1,1,1) if both are st, and (2,2) if both are cr. Choose the maximal ideal 𝔪 of the corresponding Q-ordinary derived Hecke algebra from π; U_v∉𝔪 for v∈S_p^{st}. Enlarge E so k=k(𝔪) contains every eigenvalue of the residual representation. The selected characteristic-zero representation has dimension two.

Required API:

- `CrystallineCM.PreparedPGL2Level_level_components`: Membership is componentwise membership in the specified maximal, Iwahori or pro-v Iwahori subgroup; the auxiliary level is preserved.
- `CrystallineCM.PreparedPGL2Level_unitary_partitions`: The chosen lift ṽ and the cr/st flags determine exactly the displayed three partitions; a lone st branch is placed second in the split Levi dictionary.
- `CrystallineCM.PreparedPGL2Level_residual_hecke_ideal`: The π eigencharacter selects 𝔪; U_v is a unit after localization at every st place, and k contains the residual eigenvalues.
- `CrystallineCM.PreparedPGL2Level_localized_perfectness`: The localized coefficient complex is perfect at this K, using neatness in the auxiliary case and Proposition 5.5.3 with ζ_p∈F otherwise.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.PreparedPGL2Level_test_three_branches`: Both st gives the Borel (1,1,1,1); both cr gives Siegel (2,2); exactly one st gives (2,1,1).
- `CrystallineCM.PreparedPGL2Level_test_non_neat`: For S=S_p∪R there is no auxiliary neatness argument. The ζ_p∈F hypothesis and localized perfectness input are required.

The coefficient O(χ^{-1}) uses χ_v(a/d)^{-1} at Iwahori v∈R, trivial outside R; each χ_v factors through the residue field k_v× and is trivial modulo ϖ; a/d is reduced to k_v×.

Fix the ordered distinct residual Frobenius eigenvalues. The corresponding universal unframed global deformation ring R_{S_{χ,Q}} (framing at T gives the separate ring R^T_{S_{χ,Q}}) has the O[Δ_Q]-structure from inertia on the selected lifted eigenline, Δ_Q=∏_{v∈Q}k_v×(p).

Killing the Δ_Q augmentation ideal enforces unramifiedness at Q and gives a quotient R_{S_{χ,Q}}→R_{S_χ}; allowing Q-ramification does not define an unrestricted forgetting map of deformation functors.
- `CrystallineCM.TaylorWilesDeformationProblem_diamond`: The O[Δ_Q]-action is the universal inertia character on the selected residual Frobenius eigenline.
- `CrystallineCM.TaylorWilesDeformationProblem_augmentation`: Augmenting Δ_Q kills that inertia character and recovers the unramified chosen-eigenline quotient.

Acceptance tests:

- `CrystallineCM.TaylorWilesDeformationProblem_test_empty_q`: For Q=∅, Δ_Q=1 and the problem reduces to S_χ.
- `CrystallineCM.TaylorWilesDeformationProblem_test_two_eigenvalues`: Equal residual Frobenius eigenvalues do not give the chosen-eigenline Taylor–Wiles datum.
- `CrystallineCM.TaylorWilesDeformationProblem_test_augmentation`: After Δ_Q-augmentation the selected inertia character is trivial, matching the finite-cover augmentation in Lemma 5.6.4.

**The same at Taylor–Wiles level** (`CrystallineCM.taylor_wiles_deformation_to_hecke_surjection`).

**Automorphy lifting in the special case** (`CrystallineCM.prepared_barsotti_tate_lifting`). With the data and hypotheses (1)–(15), let ρ : G_F → GL₂(Q̄_p) be continuous with (1) ρ̄ ≅ r̄_{π,ι} and det ρ = ε^{−1}_p; (2) ρ|_{G_{F_v}} Barsotti–Tate for v ∈ S^cr_p; (3) r_ι(π)|_{G_{F_v}} ordinary iff ρ|_{G_{F_v}} ordinary, for v ∈ S^cr_p; (4) ρ|_{G_{F_v}} a non-crystalline extension of ε^{−1}_p by the trivial character for v ∈ S^st_p; (5) ρ unramified at v ∉ S; (6) ρ|_{G_{F_v}} unipotently ramified for v ∈ R. Then ρ ≅ r_ι(Π) for a cuspidal Π of PGL₂(𝔸_F) of weight 0.

Source: CN, Proposition 5.6.1, p.82.

Prerequisites: **CL.9**: The data and hypotheses (1)–(15) of the special case of Theorem 5.2; **CL.9**: Hecke-valued Galois representations satisfy the deformation problem 𝒮_χ; **CL.9**: The same at Taylor–Wiles level; **CL.9**: Patching complexes of homology; **CL.9**: Taylor–Wiles data for GL₂ over CM fields without enormous image (Allen–Khare–Thorne); **CL.8**: Automorphic components propagate through the special fibre; **CL.8**: Support of patched cohomology at points of automorphic components; **LocalGaloisDeformationRings:R08.4** (bt ring unique generalisation); **LocalGaloisDeformationRings:L7** (snowden ordinary ring trivial residual); **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.5**; **DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra:P8**; **CL.9**: Prepared PGL₂ level and unitary parabolic branches.

**Reduction of Theorem 5.2 to Proposition 5.6.1 by solvable base change** (`CrystallineCM.solvable_preparation_and_descent_qualified`). Under the hypotheses of the qualified potentially Barsotti–Tate lifting theorem in CL.9, including d_cyc≠3 or projective image not A₄, Theorem 5.2 follows from Automorphy lifting in the special case (CL.9): choose a finite set V of auxiliary places as in the proof of [AKT23, Thm. A.14]; a solvable Galois CM extension F₀/F in which V splits, π_{F₀} has Iwahori-fixed vectors everywhere, bad places become unipotent with q_w ≡ 1 mod p and trivial ρ̄, every p-adic place of F₀⁺ splits with residue field bigger than F_p and the degree condition holds, potentially crystalline places become crystalline with π unramified (and r_ι(π) crystalline by Crystallinity at p of automorphic Galois representations over CM and totally real fields (CL.7), ordinary iff ρ is), and non-potentially-crystalline places become non-crystalline extensions of ε^{−1}_p by 1; a further composite F₁ with three imaginary quadratic fields; if ζ_p ∉ F, two auxiliary degree-one places v₀, v₀′ from A reducibility criterion for mod-p representations (variant of DDT 4.11) (CL.9) and Chebotarev; then solvable descent [ACC+18, Prop. 6.5.13]. Choose the preparation linearly disjoint from the full residual-plus-cyclotomic field, so both the projective image and d_cyc are preserved and the corrected finite-image criterion applies.

Prerequisites: **CL.9**: Automorphy lifting in the special case; **CL.7**: Crystallinity at p of automorphic Galois representations over CM and totally real fields; **CL.9**: A reducibility criterion for mod-p representations (variant of DDT 4.11); **PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R23.5**; **ModularityAndLanglandsExtensions:ML.5**; **PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.5** (genericity normal closure restriction).

**Potentially Barsotti–Tate automorphy lifting over imaginary CM fields** (`CrystallineCM.potentially_barsotti_tate_lifting_qualified`). Let F be an imaginary CM field, p an odd prime and ρ : G_F → GL₂(Q̄_p) continuous with: (1) ρ unramified almost everywhere and det ρ = ε_p^{−1}; (2) for each v | p, ρ|_{G_{F_v}} potentially semistable with all labelled Hodge–Tate weights (0,1); (3) ρ̄ decomposed generic and ρ̄|_{G_{F(ζ_p)}} irreducible; (4) if p = 5 and the projective image of ρ̄(G_{F(ζ₅)}) is conjugate to PSL₂(F₅), the extension of F cut out by the projective image of ρ̄ does not contain ζ₅; (5) there are a cuspidal π of PGL₂(𝔸_F) and ι : Q̄_p ≅ C with (a) π regular algebraic of weight 0, (b) for v | p with ρ|_{G_{F_v}} potentially crystalline: r_ι(π)|_{G_{F_v}} is potentially ordinary of weight 0 ([Ger19, §5.2]) iff ρ|_{G_{F_v}} is, and rec_{F_v}(π_v) has monodromy 0, (c) for v | p with ρ|_{G_{F_v}} not potentially crystalline: π is ι-ordinary of weight 0 at v and r_ι(π)|_{G_{F_v}} is not potentially crystalline, (d) ρ̄ ≅ r̄_ι(π). Assume in addition d_cyc=[F(ζ_p):F]≠3 or the projective image of ρ̄(G_F) is not A₄. Then ρ is automorphic: ρ ≅ r_ι(Π) for a cuspidal Π of PGL₂(𝔸_F), regular algebraic of weight 0.

## Required supplier interfaces

The following exports fix the precise generality of the imported mathematics. Their consuming layers identify where they enter the construction. Each belongs to its named supplier.

**SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.0:abelian-category** (used in CL.0, CL.1, CL.3). The abelian category of smooth representations of the locally profinite groups and open monoids Δ̃, Δ⁺, Δ used here, over O/ϖ^m; continuous compact-open invariants, enough injectives, restriction preserving injectives in the cases of CN §2.2.2, and their bounded-below derived functors. Algebraic Representation is only a carrier. Include the coefficient-injective embedding into smooth coinduction Ind₁^{P(L)}I and the acyclicity test on these objects used via Emerton Lemma 2.1.10 in CN Lemma 2.3.6.

Consumption source: CN, §2.1.13, p.19; CN, Lemma 2.3.6, pp.36–37.

**SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.2** (used in CL.2, CL.3, CL.4, CL.5). Integral unnormalized smooth induction for P(L)\G(L) compact, functions compact modulo P, restriction and tensor identity over O/ϖ^m; exactness in precisely these compact quotient cases. Do not use characteristic-zero Jacquet exactness for p-torsion coefficients. The separately normalized complex Jacquet/geometric lemma is needed in CN Theorem 3.1.2. Include smooth coinduction from the trivial subgroup of P(L): for coefficient-injective I, locally constant I-valued functions on the free right U₀-space P(L)w₀^P U₀ are injective smooth U₀-modules, with evaluation F(x)=f(x)(1) identifying them with I°_{w₀^P}(Ind₁^{P(L)}I). This is the precise CN Lemma 2.3.6 input; it is not Borel N(O)-acyclicity. For Theorem 4.1.3, export the derived Mackey decomposition for restriction of this induction to (K₁⋉U₁); the identity double-coset term is a natural Hecke-equivariant summand. For Theorem 3.1.2, include Bernstein–Zelevinsky classification and the identity-only normalized geometric-lemma calculation for strictly ordered block slopes: a nonzero monodromy block has a positive-length Steinberg factor whose maximal-compact invariants vanish. These are separate characteristic-zero statements, not consequences of integral induction exactness.

Consumption source: CN, Proposition 2.2.15, p.31; CN, Lemma 2.3.6, pp.36–37.

**tauceti:TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology#layer-10-continuous-cohomology-in-all-degrees** (used in CL.1, CL.3, CL.5). Continuous cochains with finite torsion coefficients, finite-index transfer, and comparison to smooth compact invariants (layer 10), together with the torsion-free abelian Z_p^r cohomological-dimension and coefficient-dual exterior-power computation (layer 11). For U₀≅Z_p^r, H^i_cont(U₀,R_m)=Hom_cont,Z_p(∧^i_Z_p U₀,R_m), with the contragredient conjugation action and rank r; H⁰=R_m. The general Koszul carrier is supplied by its algebraic owner. Hochschild–Serre/derived composition and ordinary open-cell vanishing belong separately to SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups; ProfiniteCohomology explicitly excludes the former.

Consumption source: CN, Definition 2.2.3, pp.26–27; CN, Lemma 2.3.17, p.42.

**ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.1, ALS.3, ALS.4, ALS.6** and **CompletedCohomologyPartII:CC.0, CC.1, CC.2, CC.4, CC.6, CC.7** (used in CL.1, CL.3, CL.5, CL.8). Import the finite-level coefficient complexes from ALS.1, their Hecke/support maps from ALS.3–ALS.4 and finite-cover descent from ALS.6. CC.0 assembles the actual level-indexed arithmetic towers and conjugation maps; CC.1 supplies their smooth level colimits; CC.2 constructs completion and the homotopy inverse limit in the coefficient exponent with the required Milnor and reduction comparisons. CC.4 supplies completed equivariant chain models and derived finite-level recovery; CC.6 supplies continuous completed descent and compact-open derived comparison; CC.7 supplies the derived support and boundary triangle. Completion is not identified with ordinary inverse limit without its hypotheses. For Lemma 4.1.6, combine the ALS.2 arithmetic nilmanifold fibration, Leray–Serre and strong approximation with this level colimit to prove that positive integral torsion cohomology dies in the full congruence tower. That arithmetic acyclicity remains an obligation of CL.5; the finite characteristic-zero Lie-algebra formula and generic limit functor alone do not establish it.

Consumption source: CN, §2.2.7, p.28.

**SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.4** (used in CL.0, CL.4, CL.6). Integral unnormalized local Satake map for GL_n and split U(n,n), in geometric Frobenius conventions; characteristic polynomials use q^{i(i−1)/2}. Supply its Siegel transform and relation with the Levi embedding, with rescaling and conjugation handled by the CL.0 and CL.6 constructions.

Consumption source: CN, Lemma 2.1.15, p.20; Remark 2.1.16.

**PadicHodgeTheory:R06.2** (used in CL.4, CL.7). Filtered (φ,N)-modules for finite extensions L/Q_p with E-coefficients, geometric Frobenius slopes v_p normalized v_p(p)=1, t_N=t_H and subobject inequalities, weak admissibility implies admissibility, functorial crystalline/semistable subrepresentations and finite coefficient base change; inverse cyclotomic Hodge–Tate weight +1.

Consumption source: CN, Theorem 3.1.2, pp.43–44.

**PadicHodgeTheory:R06.3** (used in CL.4, CL.9). Semistable Weil–Deligne parameters at p compatible with geometric Frobenius, coefficient extension and determinant, and crystalline iff semistable with N=0 (in the stated unramified descent setting).

Consumption source: CN, Theorem 3.1.2, pp.43–44.

**AutomorphicGaloisRepresentationsPartII:AG2.2** (used in CL.4, CL.7). The 2n-dimensional representation r_ι(π) for a cohomological cuspidal representation of quasi-split U(n,n) via stable base change to GL_{2n}(A_F), with the exact λ̃-Hodge–Tate dictionary and determinant normalizations. Supply HLTT representations for unpolarized regular algebraic GL_n over CM or totally real F. State explicitly the field hypotheses of the char-zero local–global export: CN Theorem 2.1.19(3) has imaginary-quadratic and p-splitting hypotheses. An extension/base-change argument giving the full CM scope of Theorem 3.1.2 is required; the restricted export alone does not establish it.

Consumption source: CN, Theorem 3.1.2, pp.43–44.

**AutomorphicGaloisRepresentationsPartII:AG2.5** (used in CL.4, CL.9). Nonselfdual local–global comparison at p at Iwahori level sufficient to give semistability and the Frobenius slopes used in CN Theorem 3.1.2. Also away-p monodromy/type bounds for the χ_v and unipotent deformation conditions in CN Propositions 5.6.2–3; retain N rather than assert full local Langlands equality from unramified traces.

Consumption source: CN, Theorem 3.1.2, pp.43–44.

**PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.0** (used in CL.5, CL.6). The non-Eisenstein Siegel-boundary localization of ACC+ Theorem 3.4.2 and Newton–Thorne Corollary 2.11 as a Hecke-equivariant derived retract with the dual Weyl coefficient evaluation map. The residual 2n representation is ρ̄_m⊕ρ̄_m^{c,∨}(1−2n); irreducibility is imposed on its n-dimensional Levi constituent, not on this sum. Include the integral coefficient retract used in CN Corollary 4.1.9, without a Fontaine–Laffaille restriction. Also the separate ACC+ Corollary 2.4.4 integral coefficient retract after the NT16 Lemma 2.10 Levi splitting and Cab84 P-stability argument, as used in Lemma 4.2.3. Do not identify these two retracts.

Consumption source: CN, Corollary 4.1.9, p.57; CN, Lemma 4.2.3, p.60.

**IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants:IHG.5** (used in CL.0, CL.7, CL.8). CN Theorem 2.1.20 (residual), Theorem 2.1.24 (integral uniform nilpotent exponent), and Proposition 5.5.2 uniform-exponent Galois representations for integral derived Hecke images and O/ϖ^m cohomology. N depends only on n,[F:Q], not m, weights or levels. Include finite-level idempotent localization and inverse-limit/degree assembly preserving Frobenius characteristic coefficients; arithmetic/geometric Frobenius conversion is explicit. Existing IHG tower algebra alone does not assert this arithmetic export.

Consumption source: CN, Theorem 2.1.24, p.23; CN, Proposition 5.5.2, pp.80–81.

**DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra:P9** (used in CL.8). ACC+ Lemma 6.3.7 localization and derived Euler-length identity for perfect S∞-complexes with finite derived Hecke action modulo nilpotents, along ϖ and one-dimensional points, plus CG Lemma 6.2 amplitude/depth inequality. No strict T∞-module model is assumed. Need the nonzero-length propagation under common special-fibre actions used in CN Proposition 5.4.2.

Consumption source: CN, §5.4, Proposition 5.4.2, pp.78–79.

**DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra:P8** (used in CL.8, CL.9). Patch the two families C_{χ,Q_N}, C_{1,Q_N} with fixed residual identification, uniformly bounded perfect O[Δ_Q]-models, framing variables, O[[Δ∞]] action, finite Hecke images, local tensor rings, augmentation recovery and compatibility modulo ϖ. The resulting rings have dimension dim S∞−l₀, l₀=[F⁺:Q], q₀=[F⁺:Q] in the GL₂ CM application; proving these arithmetic hypotheses is the CL.9 application.

Consumption source: CN, Proposition 5.6.1, p.82.

**tauceti:TauCetiRoadmap/ClassFieldTheory#layer-12-separate-arithmetic-global-existence-the-norm-index-and-the-global-correspondence** (used in CL.7). Prime-to-p finite characters with prescribed local unramified values at the two selected p-adic places and trivial restriction at a fixed decomposed-generic split prime, allowing coefficient extension. Supply the precise Grunwald–Wang/character extension result used by the CN sub-lemma, with its obstruction and the allowed prime-to-p choices proved to avoid it.

Consumption source: CN, Sub-lemma 1, pp.70–71.

**ModularityAndLanglandsExtensions:ML.5** (used in CL.7, CL.9). Solvable CM base change/descent for PGL₂ with trivial central character and regular algebraic weight 0; if ρ|G_{F′} is irreducible and realized by a cuspidal Π, descend to ρ over F. Also cyclic GL_n base change (iterating prime-degree base change where needed) for the crystalline theorem, with irreducibility preserving cuspidality, as in ACC+ Proposition 6.5.13 and CN Theorem 4.3.1.

Consumption source: CN, §4.3, Theorem 4.3.1, p.73.

**PotentialModularityAndCompatibleSystems:R23.5** (used in CL.7, CL.9). Solvable Galois CM extensions with prescribed local splitting/trivialization/semistability, degree distribution and disjointness from any fixed finite residual-plus-cyclotomic field; the V-set argument and imaginary-quadratic composita of CN §5.6/AKT Theorem A.14. Supply preparation preserving the full residual image and cyclotomic degree, not only irreducibility. For Theorem 4.3.1, also supply the cyclic CM extension F₁/F (allowing F totally real) with [(F₁)⁺:F⁺]≥4, taking F⁺=F in the totally real case, disjoint from the residual field, containing an imaginary quadratic field, with all p-adic F₁⁺ places split in F₁ and the selected v and v^c split completely in F₁. Thus the local fields at these places are unchanged; crystallinity is obtained directly, without ramified descent.

Consumption source: CN, §4.3, Theorem 4.3.1, p.73.

**tauceti:TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups#layer-7-structure-theory** (used in CL.3). Generic parabolic double Bruhat decomposition and algebraic closure order for split connected reductive groups; CL.3 compares this decomposition with the p-adic topology. The pinned GL₂ Bruhat declaration is a rank-one sanity check, not this general supplier.

Consumption source: CN, §2.3.1, Lemma 2.3.2, p.33.

**PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure:PA.0** (used in CL.0, CL.2, CL.5, CL.6). Integral algebraic induction/dual Weyl modules with coefficient extension and reduction, Levi evaluation onto V_{λ_τ̃}⊗V_{−w₀λ_{τ̃c}}, Schubert evaluation surjectivity after reduction and the positive-root weight description of its kernel. Generic highest-weight theory is owned by the representation-theory roadmap, not this application. Export the integral Levi-equivariant splitting V_{λ̃}=V_λ⊕W (NT16 Lemma 2.10); identify W⊗E=(1−U) V_{λ̃,E} (Cab84 proof of Proposition 2) to prove P(O)-stability before invoking the dual coefficient retract.

Consumption source: CN, Lemma 2.1.12, pp.17–18.

**DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra:R03.3** (used in CL.3). General finite Koszul complexes of commuting endomorphisms, with the exterior-power carrier, zero-differential comparison, coefficient base change and regular-sequence resolution. Export the compact Z_p^r continuous-cochain computation via the ProfiniteCohomology owner; do not create a second generic Koszul complex here or inside an arithmetic lifting theorem.

Consumption source: CN, §2.3.16, pp.41–42; Lemma 2.3.17 on p.42.

**SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.0:derived-extension** (used in CL.3). For a profinite K with cofinal congruence K_M, perfect underlying R-complexes in D⁺_sm(K,R) become isomorphic, after sufficiently deep restriction, to the constant action on the underlying complex. Prove colim_M Hom(B_M,A_M)≅Hom(B,A) using dualizability, derived tensor/invariants adjunction and smoothness. This is the general categorical step of CN Lemma 2.3.17, not a blanket formality statement for all U.

Consumption source: CN, §2.3.16, pp.41–42; Lemma 2.3.17 on p.42.

**ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.6** (used in CL.8, CL.9). AKT Theorem 5.11 / CN Proposition 5.5.3: at non-neat PGL₂ levels with p odd, ζ_p∈F, trivial mod-residue coefficients and absolutely irreducible residual Galois representation, cohomology above the real dimension vanishes and the localized complex is perfect over O or O/ϖ^m; explain finite stabilizer cohomology. Lowest-degree descent alone does not imply this. Perfectness requires bounded derived residue reduction and finite cohomology via the AKT Lemma 3.2 minimal-complex criterion; bounded cohomology alone over O/ϖ^m is insufficient. Include perfect O[Δ]-models at the finite abelian p-covers used in Lemma 5.6.4 and their derived augmentation identification with the base complex.

Consumption source: CN, Proposition 5.5.3, p.81; AKT, Theorem 5.11, p.46; proof completed on pp.47–48.

**ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.5** (used in CL.9). AKT Theorem 5.10 for PGL₂ over a CM field: a Galois-type non-Eisenstein maximal ideal has rational cohomology only in [D,2D], D=[F⁺:Q], and each characteristic-zero Hecke character is realized by a cuspidal regular-algebraic PGL₂ representation. Retain the weight/central-character descent and tame-level fixed-vector hypotheses. This supplies q₀=l₀=D, not the GL₂ range with l₀=2D−1.

Consumption source: AKT, Theorem 5.10(2–3), p.45.

**SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups:SR.0:derived-extension** (used in CL.1, CL.3, CL.5, CL.6). Derived invariants for smooth semidirect products compose: RΓ(K⋉U,−)≅RΓ(K,RΓ(U,−)) with the precise restriction/injectivity and inflation/projection-formula hypotheses, giving the Hecke-equivariant comparison of CN Lemma 4.1.7 and Lemma 4.2.3. Also export the ordinary open-cell quotient vanishing from the contracting, locally nilpotent ũ-action used in Lemma 2.3.6 (Hauseux Lemma 3.3.1 argument), including its higher derived cohomology; it does not follow merely from H⁰-localization. Preserve the compact determinant-unit orientation in Lemma 2.3.8.

Consumption source: CN, Lemma 4.1.7, p.56; CN, Lemma 2.3.6, pp.36–37.

**ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces:ALS.3** (used in CL.0). The adelic center acts on the localized arithmetic cohomology; ray-class congruence and archimedean connectedness compare the central operator at a p-adic uniformizer with a good-place central Hecke operator. With global class-field reciprocity and Chebotarev, the unique generalized eigenvalue is ψ(Art_{F_v}(ϖ_v)), where ψ=ε̄_p^{n(n−1)/2}detρ̄. Respect the good-place q^{n(n−1)/2}T_{w,n} normalization and the fact that v itself may be ramified.

Consumption source: CN, Lemma 2.1.21 and its proof, pp.22–23.

**PadicFamilies:L0a** (used in CL.4). For commuting operators on a finite-dimensional p-adic E-vector space, decompose into simultaneous generalized eigenspaces after finite splitting-field extension and descend the sum of the pieces where every rescaled eigenvalue has valuation zero. Prove independence of the splitting field, functoriality and equality with the largest stable subspace whose operator eigenvalues are all units. Fitting over an Artinian and Noetherian module detects nonzero eigenvalues, not valuation-zero eigenvalues over E.

Consumption source: CN, §3.1, p.43.

**IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants:IHG.1** (used in CL.7). Extend compatible-local-reconstruction from a finite flat target A to the complete Noetherian local O-algebras/finite torsion quotients A used in Proposition 4.2.13. A is allowed to have ϖ-torsion. Only the auxiliary characteristic-zero lift algebra Ã is finite flat. With disjoint residual local constituent sets, use the same GMA idempotent/corner reconstruction to descend the chosen n-dimensional constituent and compare its characteristic polynomial to the local finite-flat lifts, preserving quotient/base-change compatibility.

Consumption source: CN, Proposition 4.2.13 proof, pp.69–71.

**GlobalGaloisDeformations:R04.5** (used in CL.9). AKT Appendix A.2–A.6 with no enormous-image assumption: for p odd and ρ̄|G_{F(ζ_p)} absolutely irreducible, with the stated p=5 PSL₂ exception excluded, prove Lemma A.5 finite-image detection of every nonzero dual-Selmer cocycle by a cyclotomic-kernel element with distinct eigenvalues, including the small p=3,5 cases. Apply Chebotarev to choose fixed-size degree-one Taylor–Wiles sets of level N, avoiding fixed bad places and satisfying the A.6 imaginary-quadratic split conditions. Export A.4 relative framed presentation for this exact CM fixed-determinant local datum: with T=S the number of generators is g=q−3[F⁺:Q]−1+|S|, and the selection kills the relevant dual Selmer group.

## Sources and statement scope

**CN** means Ana Caraiani and James Newton, *On the modularity of elliptic curves over imaginary quadratic fields*, [arXiv:2301.10509v3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10509v3), 27 March 2025. All CN theorem numbers and printed pages refer to this version. The owned arguments use §§2.1–2.3, 3.1, 4.1–4.3 and 5.4–5.6; §§3.2–3.3 and 5.3 identify imported determinant and deformation interfaces. The elliptic-curve and modular-curve applications in §§6–7 belong to the sibling roadmap.

**AKT** means Patrick B. Allen, Chandrashekhar Khare and Jack A. Thorne, *Modularity of GL₂(F_p)-representations over CM fields*, [arXiv:1910.12986v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12986v2), 2 September 2022; the PDF title page is dated 5 September 2022. Its bibliographic journal reference is *Cambridge Journal of Mathematics* 11 (2023), 1–124, DOI [10.4310/CJM.2023.v11.n1.a1](https://doi.org/10.4310/CJM.2023.v11.n1.a1). The AKT numbering and PDF pages here refer to the preprint, including the PGL₂ cohomology interfaces and Appendix A. No identification of every preprint statement with the version of record is asserted.

Citations inside supplier interfaces such as ACC+18, NT16, Cab84, CG and Ger19 retain CN's bibliographic abbreviations. They identify the supplier's proof inputs; the precise export required by this roadmap is written under that supplier stage above. CN's reference list is on pp.102–106. All target statements here are mathematical descriptions rather than source transcriptions.

The coefficient rescaling uses the inverse character evaluated at the acting element (CN (2.1.7), p.20). The unitary Hecke polynomial includes the term X^{2n−j} (CN (2.1.6), p.18). Compact unipotent cohomology is the coefficient-valued dual of the exterior power (CN Lemma 2.3.17, p.42), with contragredient conjugation action. In the degree-shifting proof the incoming differential is d_r:E_r^{q−r,d−q+r−1}→E_r^{q,d−q} (CN Proposition 4.2.6, p.64). These conventions are built into the targets.

The finite-image exception in CN Lemma 5.6.5, p.86, controls the scope of the final lifting theorem. Over F₇, take i=((0,1),(−1,0)), j=((2,3),(3,−2)) and h=(−1+i+j+ij)/2. The generated binary tetrahedral group has quaternion subgroup Q₈ and an order-three quotient generated by h. Twisting its inclusion by the character χ(h)=2, χ(Q₈)=1 gives determinant of order three. Outside the determinant kernel the squared trace is (1+det)², yet the kernel acts absolutely irreducibly. Thus the trace condition alone does not give reducibility in the cubic-tetrahedral case. CL.9 states the qualified criterion and preserves the full residual image and cyclotomic degree during preparation. It makes no assertion that the unrestricted lifting theorem is false.

For CN §4.1.1, p.53, the unipotent coefficient object has a general cohomological-dimension bound. Exact nonvanishing in every degree is specified here for zero selected weights. The degree-shifting argument uses that case, rather than an unproved general-weight nonvanishing assertion.
