# Roadmap: Néron models and semistable abelian varieties

This roadmap builds the scheme-theoretic reduction theory of abelian varieties over arithmetic
bases: finite-type Néron models over excellent discrete valuation rings and over Dedekind schemes
such as rings of integers and of `S`-integers, with the Néron mapping property as the defining
universal property; their special fibres, identity components and finite étale component groups;
semistable reduction, Grothendieck's monodromy criterion and the semistable reduction theorem
after a finite extension; the Raynaud extension and the polarised uniformisation of a
degenerating abelian variety; the degree-zero Picard scheme of a regular semistable curve, the
identification of its toric characters with the integral first homology of the dual graph, the
integral monodromy pairing, the component group as its cokernel and Grothendieck's pairing on
component groups; and the Galois-theoretic consequences — Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich, isogeny
invariance of good reduction, the `p`-adic comparison at the residue prime, the conductor of a
semistable abelian variety, the local Euler polynomial at bad places — together with the exact
interfaces that level lowering, the Faltings height, the isogeny theorem and the modularity of
abelian surfaces consume. The end theorems are the local existence theorem of Néron models,
Grothendieck's criterion `A semistable ⇔ inertia unipotent on T_ℓ(A)`, Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich,
the identification `Φ_A ≅ coker(X_{A^∨} → Hom(X_A, ℤ))` of the component group with the
cokernel of the monodromy pairing, and the equation-level–scheme-level comparison of every
reduction invariant of an elliptic curve.

The objects are schemes and group schemes over the base, carried with their generic-fibre
markings; the mapping property quantifies over all smooth test schemes, and the finite-type
convention is enforced. Equation-level reduction theory of elliptic curves, semistable reduction
of curves, Jacobians of smooth curves, Néron models of tori, Tate modules and conductors of
Galois representations, and the general theory of formal schemes, Picard functors and group
spaces are consumed from the roadmaps named below, not rebuilt.

## Scope and ownership

The roadmap owns:

- the Néron mapping property as a predicate on `Over S` relative to a base morphism `j : η → S`,
  marked finite-type Néron models, weak Néron models, extension of morphisms and uniqueness;
- the group law on a Néron model and the extension of homomorphisms; smoothening and local
  existence over an excellent discrete valuation ring; spreading out and the Dedekind
  local-to-global construction; the comparison with abelian-scheme models; étale base change; the
  invariant-differential lattice of a Néron model and its Hodge line;
- the identity component and the finite étale component group of the special fibre, with the
  distinction between rational and geometric components; the Chevalley decomposition of the
  identity fibre; the toric character lattice of a Néron special fibre and its functoriality;
  functoriality under isogeny with the correct (non-exact) statements;
- for elliptic curves: the identification of the equation-level filtration `E₁ ⊂ E₀ ⊂ E` with
  the Néron model, the smooth locus of the minimal regular model as the Néron model, the
  geometric configurations attached to the reduction symbol in every residue characteristic,
  and the geometric component groups by type;
- the semistable reduction predicate and its invariance under isogeny and identity-model base
  change; the toric–finite filtration of the Tate module, Weil orthogonality, unipotence of
  inertia, Grothendieck's monodromy criterion, semistable reduction after a finite separable
  extension, and the full-level criterion; the Raynaud extension and the polarised rigid
  uniformisation with its lattice and valuation pairing;
- the degree-zero Picard scheme of a regular semistable curve over a discrete valuation ring,
  the normalisation sequence, the integral cycle lattice of the dual multigraph and its
  identification with the toric characters, the Picard–Néron identity comparison, the integral
  monodromy pairing of a semistable abelian variety and its graph formula for Jacobians, the
  component group as a cokernel, Grothendieck's pairing on component groups, the
  intersection-matrix description, the one-node hyperelliptic curves of Bhargava–Gross–Wang
  with their generalised Jacobians, two-torsion and odd-factor torsors, and the semi-abelian
  Picard scheme of a stable family;
- Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich, isogeny invariance of good reduction, the crystalline and semistable
  comparison for the `p`-adic Tate module (stated here because no roadmap below this one states
  it), the conductor interface and the semistable conductor formula, the local Euler polynomial
  at bad places and the residual conductor;
- the interfaces of Layer 6: degeneracy-map functoriality, character exact sequences with
  verified kernels, semistable and isogeny behaviour of the differential lattice, the
  equation-level–scheme-level comparisons for elliptic curves, the compatible system of
  cohomology of an abelian variety, the semistable-ordinary adapters for abelian surfaces over
  `ℚ₂`, and the full-level extension for curves.

It leaves to other roadmaps, and consumes from them:

- **EllipticCurves** (Tau Ceti), Layers 1, 3 and 4: the minimal Weierstrass model, Mathlib's
  reduction predicates, the reduction map, `E₀(K)`, `E₁(K)` and its identification with the
  formal group, the full Tate algorithm with its `ReductionSymbol`, the algorithmic exponent
  `v(Δ) − m + 1`, the local index `c_p = [E(K) : E₀(K)]`, the Tate curve and its point
  uniformisation, the invariant differential at the level of the function field, the minimal
  discriminant, the Tate module of an elliptic curve with its Galois action and Weil pairing,
  the three equation-level Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich statements, and the point count over finite
  fields. That roadmap excludes Néron models by design; this roadmap owns the comparisons.
- **StableReduction** (Tau Ceti), Layers 0–1 and 3–7: models over a discrete valuation ring with
  their generic-fibre markings (`TauCeti.Model`), nodes, normalisation and the dual graph with
  its Betti number, stable curves, blow-ups and intersection theory on arithmetic surfaces,
  regular and minimal models with their components and multiplicities, numerical types and the
  numerical Picard group `TauCeti.NumericalType.Pic` with its degree map and torsion, semistable
  reduction of curves and the curve–Jacobian criterion. StableReduction's introduction assigns
  the geometric meaning of the elliptic reduction symbol to its Layer 5 without listing it as a
  target; this roadmap states that dictionary (2.8) on top of Layer 5's minimal regular model.
- **JacobianChallenge** (Tau Ceti), Layers D–F: the Picard functor, Jacobian and Abel–Jacobi map
  of a smooth proper curve over a field.
- **AlgebraicCurves** (Tau Ceti), Layer 10: hyperelliptic models.
- **ReductiveGroups** (Tau Ceti), Layers 4 and 7: character lattices of tori, exactness of the
  character functor, and the Galois action on characters.
- **ReductiveGroupsPartII** (Tau Ceti), RG2.0a, RG2.3.1 and RG2.3.2: norm-one tori and Weil
  restriction; quotients of group schemes over a base of dimension at most one; locally
  finite-type Néron models of tori, their finite-type and connected open subgroups and the
  affine mapping property `lftMappingProperty`. Those models satisfy the mapping property of
  1.1 but are not finite-type Néron models; the comparison of the two mapping properties is
  stated in RG2.3.2's terms there and is not restated here.
- **ModularCurves** (Tau Ceti), Layer 1: the scheme-theoretic elliptic curve attached to a
  Weierstrass equation with unit discriminant over a base.
- **ProfiniteCohomology** (Tau Ceti), Layer 2: cup products in Galois cohomology.
- **SchemeAndStackFoundations** SF.0 §5–§7 (henselisation, excellent rings, Zariski's main
  theorem), SF.1c (group spaces, torsors and quotients), SF.2f (Brauer groups), SF.3 (Picard
  torsors T353, the Picard–Brauer sequence T354, rational divisor classes on hyperelliptic curves
  T355, invariant differentials of a group scheme T361) and SF.4b–d (formal schemes, formal
  completion and algebraisation; modifications and resolution; moduli of stable curves).
- **AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry** T526 (Artin approximation over an excellent discrete
  valuation ring), T527 (the relative Picard fppf sheaf), T539 (its representability) and T543
  (`Pic^τ` and the identity component).
- **AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli** A1 (abelian schemes over a base, rigidity, homomorphisms,
  products), A2 (the dual abelian scheme and the Poincaré biextension) and A3 (finite flat
  torsion, isogenies, the Weil pairing on torsion and Tate modules, `p`-divisible groups).
- **ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations** R01.2 (decomposition and inertia groups, quasi-unipotence,
  the Weil–Deligne representation and its local Euler factor), R01.3 (Artin and Swan conductors
  with the monodromy term, residual conductors, the elliptic conductor and Ogg's formula) and
  R01.6 (Tate modules of abelian varieties, the Weil pairing on Tate modules, the good-reduction
  Frobenius polynomial, the local Euler factor of an abelian variety and its comparison with
  Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.localPolynomial`).
- **NeronModelsAndSemistableAbelianVarieties Part II**: Ferrand pinching and conductor squares,
  genus-one fibres and their forms, multiple fibres over excellent discrete valuation rings,
  global Weierstrass models and Jacobians of genus-one curves, Picard constancy and fibre
  configurations, and the explicit models over `𝔽₂`. Part II consumes Layers 2 and 4 of this
  roadmap.
- **JacobianChallenge Part II**: the comparison of the Hodge line `det e^*Ω¹` of the Picard
  scheme of a stable family with `det π_*ω`; it consumes 4.15.
- **ModularCurvesPartII**, **SerreWeightAndLevelOptimisation**, **ArakelovGeometryAndAbelianHeights**,
  **FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems**, **SmallRamificationAndAbelianVarietyBaseCases**,
  **HeegnerPointEulerSystems**, **GrossZagierAndArithmeticHeights**,
  **ComplexMultiplicationAndExplicitReciprocity**: consumers (see Downstream consumers).

Already in Tau Ceti, used and not restated: abelian varieties over a field with their
homomorphisms, isogenies, rigidity, products and tangent spaces
(`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety`, `AbelianVariety.baseChange`, `AbelianVariety.IsIsogeny`,
`isMonHom_of_one_hom`); group objects of `Over S` and their closed subgroups, kernels and
isogenies over `Spec R` (`TauCeti.ClosedSubgroupScheme`, `kernelBaseChangeIso`, the isogeny class
of `GroupScheme/CentralIsogeny`); generic and special fibres over a discrete valuation ring and
extensionality along the generic fibre (`TauCeti.genericFiber`, `specialFiber`,

From Mathlib: the morphism classes `Smooth`, `Etale`, `IsSeparated`, `QuasiCompact`,
`LocallyOfFiniteType`, `IsProper`, `Flat`, `GeometricallyIntegral`; `Over.pullback` and the
cartesian monoidal structure of `Over X`; `GrpObj`, `IsCommMonObj`; `HenselianLocalRing`,

`Matrix.toLin'`, `AddCircle`.

Where a target here is a variant of an existing statement, the entry says in one clause how it
differs: a marked Néron model is a `TauCeti.Model` with smooth, separated and quasi-compact
structure morphism, over an arbitrary base morphism `j`, and with the mapping property (1.2);
marked extensionality and uniqueness are `ext_of_genericFiberι_eq` and `Model.subsingleton_iso`
over `Spec R` and are derived from the mapping property over arbitrary `j` (1.2, 1.4); the
component group of 2.2 is for smooth finite-type groups over any field and agrees with
`componentGroupScheme` in the affine algebraically-closed case; the cycle lattice of 4.3 is the
integral `H₁` of StableReduction's dual graph, of which that roadmap records only the Betti
number; the intersection-matrix description of 4.9 is a comparison with `NumericalType.Pic`, not
a second numerical Picard group; the semistable predicate of 3.1 is for abelian varieties and
restricts, for elliptic curves, to the local form of `WeierstrassCurve.IsSemistable`.

Nothing here is "optional": the sequencing is by layer, and every item belongs to exactly one
layer.

## Conventions

1. **Bases.** `S` is a connected Dedekind scheme (Noetherian, normal, of dimension one) with
   generic point `η`, function field `K` and inclusion `j : η → S`. Local statements use a
   discrete valuation ring `R` with fraction field `K` and residue field `k`; `k^sep` and `k̄`
   are a separable and an algebraic closure. Henselian, strictly henselian, complete, excellent,
   perfect-residue and finite-residue hypotheses are stated separately at each statement; none is
   implicit in "discrete valuation ring".
2. **The test category.** The Néron mapping property tests every smooth `S`-scheme. Testing only
   étale `S`-schemes is the weak-model condition (1.6); testing only sections or `R`-points is
   neither.
3. **Finite type.** A Néron model is smooth, separated and quasi-compact over `S`; "locally of
   finite type" is never silently accepted. The locally-finite-type Néron models of tori belong to
   ReductiveGroupsPartII.
4. **Markings.** A model is carried with its generic-fibre isomorphism, and every uniqueness or
   functoriality statement is a statement about marked models; "unique up to isomorphism" means
   unique up to the unique marked isomorphism.
5. **Dimensions.** `A` has dimension `g`; for a semistable special fibre `t` is the toric rank,
   `a` the abelian rank, and `g = t + a`; the unipotent rank `u` is recorded where the fibre is not
   semistable, with `t + a + u = g`.
6. **Components.** `Φ_A = M_k/M_k⁰` is a finite étale `k`-group; `Φ_A(k̄)` is the geometric
   component group and `Φ_A(k)` the rational one, the Galois-fixed subgroup. The Tamagawa number
   of an elliptic curve is `#Φ_E(k)`.
7. **Lattices and pairings.** Character lattices are free `ℤ`-modules with continuous residue
   Galois action. The monodromy pairing `u : X_{A^∨} × X_A → ℤ` is integral; its adjoint `u♯`
   is injective with finite cokernel; the discriminant pairing on cokernels takes values in `ℚ/ℤ`
   with the sign convention of SGA 7 I, Exposé IX. No integral unimodularity is assumed.
8. **Dual graphs.** The dual graph of a nodal curve is a finite connected multigraph: vertices
   the components of the normalisation, edges the nodes, loops and parallel edges allowed, with a
   chosen orientation; `H₁(Γ, ℤ) = ker(∂ : ℤ^E → ℤ^V)`; a non-regular node `xy = π^m` is an edge
   of length `m`.
9. **Tate modules and cohomology.** `T_ℓ(A)` is the homological Tate module with its Galois
   action; `H¹_ét(A_{K̄}, ℚ_ℓ)` is its dual. Local Euler polynomials use geometric Frobenius on
   `H¹`; Weil–Deligne representations and conductors follow the conventions of
   ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.2–R01.3. The conductor is the Artin conductor with its
   Swan part.
10. **Elliptic curves.** Equation-level objects are Mathlib's and EllipticCurves', on a minimal
    Weierstrass model; "good reduction" means the multiplicative valuation of the discriminant
    is `1`, that is, the discriminant is a unit. The reduction symbol is EllipticCurves'
    `ReductionSymbol`; "Kodaira type" is used here only for the geometric configuration attached
    to it (2.8).
11. **Names.** All new declarations live under `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Neron` (the mapping
    property, models, components, semistability and monodromy) and
    `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.Curves.SemistablePicard` (the Picard theory of Layer 4); Lean
    names given below are the names of `Suggested.lean`.

normalisation, `Excellence.IsExcellentRing`, T079–T085, T148–T157), §7 (Zariski's main theorem),

Frobenius polynomial, which consumes 1.9, and the local Euler factor of an abelian variety with
its comparison with Mathlib's `localPolynomial`). A prerequisite to a roadmap layer refers to
that layer's stated development, not to an implemented theory.

## How to read the build

The layers are in build order. Layer 1 defines the Néron mapping property and marked models,
proves uniqueness, extension and the group law, constructs models locally and globally, and
extracts the differential lattice. Layer 2 builds the identity component, the component group,
the Chevalley decomposition and the toric character lattice, and compares the elliptic
equation-level objects with the model. Layer 3 defines semistability, proves the Tate-module
filtration, Grothendieck's criterion and semistable reduction after a finite extension, and
compares the formal identity model with the Raynaud extension and the rigid uniformisation.
Layer 4 builds the Picard theory of a regular semistable curve, the integral monodromy pairing of
any semistable abelian variety, the component group as its cokernel, Grothendieck's pairing, the
intersection-matrix description, and the one-node hyperelliptic curves. Layer 5 proves
Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich, isogeny invariance of good reduction, the `p`-adic comparison, the
semistable conductor formula and the local Euler polynomial at bad places. Layer 6 packages the
interfaces for the consumers. Downstream roadmaps refer to the six layers as R11.1–R11.6. Within a
layer, subsections are in dependency order; each layer ends with worked examples and the list of
layers and roadmaps it needs.

## Layer 1: Néron models and their uniqueness

This layer fixes the object. A Néron model is a smooth separated finite-type model of an abelian
variety whose points are tested against *every* smooth scheme over the base, not only against the
base itself; the mapping property is the whole content, and the model is carried together with the
isomorphism of its generic fibre with the given variety. The layer proves the formal consequences
of the mapping property (uniqueness, extension of morphisms, the group law), constructs the model
locally over an excellent discrete valuation ring and globally over a Dedekind scheme, and
extracts the one integral invariant the height theory consumes: the lattice of invariant
differentials. Throughout, `S` is a connected Dedekind scheme with generic point `η` and function
field `K`, `j : η → S` the inclusion, and `A` an abelian variety over `K`; the abstract part works
for any morphism `j : η → S` of schemes and any object of `Over η`.

### 1.1 The Néron mapping property

Define, for a fixed morphism `j : η → S` and an object `X` of `Over S`, the predicate
`NeronMappingProperty j X`: for every `Y` in `Over S` whose structure morphism is smooth
(Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.Smooth`), the generic-restriction map

```text
Hom_S(Y, X) → Hom_η(Y ×_S η, X ×_S η),   f ↦ (Over.pullback j).map f
```

is bijective (Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2, Definition 1, p. 12). Testing only sections
`S → X`, or only étale `Y`, is a strictly weaker condition and is not this predicate. Prove the
unpacking lemmas `NeronMappingProperty.bijective`, `injective`, `surjective`, `existsUnique`
(for each generic `f` there is exactly one `g` restricting to it), `hom_ext` (two `S`-morphisms
from a smooth `Y` with equal restrictions are equal), `iff_existsUnique` (the predicate is
equivalent to unique extension for every smooth test object), `of_iso` (transport along an
isomorphism in `Over S`), `identityRestriction` (for smooth `X`, an endomorphism restricting to
the identity is the identity), and the two refutation lemmas
`not_of_restriction_not_injective` and `not_of_restriction_not_surjective`, which say that one
smooth test object with a non-injective or non-surjective restriction map refutes the property.
*Needs:* Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.Smooth`, `CategoryTheory.Over.pullback`.

**Checks.**

- `nonextendible_test` (non-example) — one smooth `Y` and one generic morphism `Y_η → X_η` that no
  `Y → X` restricts to refute `NeronMappingProperty j X`; a definition that tested only sections
  would not see this failure.
- `identity_test` — for smooth `X` with the property, an endomorphism `f : X → X` with
  `(Over.pullback j).map f = 𝟙` equals `𝟙 X`.
- `identity_base_test` (degenerate) — for `j = 𝟙 S` every object of `Over S` has the property, so
  the predicate alone carries no arithmetic content; existence statements must restrict `j` to the
  generic inclusion of a Dedekind base.

### 1.2 Marked finite-type Néron models

Define the structure `NeronModel j A`, for `A` in `Over η`, with fields: an object `model` of
`Over S`; a marking `genericIso : (Over.pullback j).obj model ≅ A`; `smooth`, `separated` and
`quasiCompact` for the structure morphism of `model` (Mathlib `Smooth`, `IsSeparated`,
`QuasiCompact`); and `mapping : NeronMappingProperty j model` (Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2,
Definition 1 and Proposition 2, pp. 12–13). Smoothness already gives local finite presentation, so
quasi-compactness is exactly what turns a locally-finite-type model into the finite-type object
this roadmap uses; the locally-finite-type models of tori that ReductiveGroupsPartII builds are
not instances of this structure. Prove the projections `NeronModel.smooth_model`,
`separated_model`, `quasiCompact_model`, `mappingProperty`, the marking identities
`generic_hom_inv`, `generic_inv_hom` and `genericIso_isIso`, the marked extensionality
`NeronModel.hom_ext` (for smooth `Y` and `f, g : Y → model`, equality of
`(Over.pullback j).map f ≫ genericIso.hom` and the same for `g` forces `f = g`),
`extension_existsUnique` (for smooth `Y` and `f : Y_η → A` there is exactly one `g : Y → model`
whose marked restriction is `f`), and `identity_unique` (an endomorphism whose marked restriction
is the marking is the identity). Over an affine base `Spec R` with `R` a discrete valuation ring
and separated target, Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.ext_of_genericFiberι_eq` already gives the
extensionality half without the mapping property; the statement here is over an arbitrary `j` and
derives it from the property. *Needs:* 1.1; Mathlib `IsSeparated`, `QuasiCompact`.

**Checks.**

- `structure_test` — the model is simultaneously smooth, separated and quasi-compact; a
  locally-finite-type carrier would fail the third conjunct.
- `hom_ext_test` — two endomorphisms of the model with equal unmarked generic restrictions are
  equal.
- `marking_test` — the marking composed with its inverse is the identity of the generic model.

### 1.3 Extension of generic morphisms

For `M : NeronModel j A`, a smooth `Y` in `Over S` and `f : Y_η → A`, define
`NeronModel.extend M Y f : Y → M.model` as the unique morphism whose marked restriction is `f`
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2, Proposition 2, p. 13). Prove `extend_restrict` (the marked
restriction of `extend M Y f` is `f`), `extend_unique` (any `g` with marked restriction `f` equals
`extend M Y f`), `extend_map` (extending the marked restriction of a given `S`-morphism returns
it), `extend_identity` (extending the marking of `M` from `M.model` itself gives `𝟙`),
`extend_precomp` (for smooth `Z, Y` and `g : Z → Y`, extending `f ∘ g_η` is `g ≫ extend M Y f`),
`extend_proof_irrel` (the extension does not depend on the smoothness proof), `extend_to_model`
(the extension from another marked model `N` of `A` has generic restriction compatible with both
markings), `extend_comp_model` (for three marked models `P, N, M` the extensions `P → N → M`
compose to the extension `P → M`), `extend_inverse_model` (the two canonical extensions between
two marked models are mutually inverse) and `extend_isIso`. *Needs:* 1.1, 1.2.

**Checks.**

- `extend_identity_test` — extending the marking returns `𝟙 M.model`.
- `extend_inverse_test` — for two marked models `M, N` of `A`, the composite
  `extend M N.model N.genericIso.hom ≫ extend N M.model M.genericIso.hom` is `𝟙 N.model`.
- `extend_restrict_test` — the extension of an arbitrary generic test map `f` has marked
  restriction exactly `f`.

### 1.4 Uniqueness of marked Néron models

Prove `NeronModel.unique_iso`: for marked models `M, N` of the same `A` over the same `j`, there is
exactly one isomorphism `e : M.model ≅ N.model` in `Over S` with
`(Over.pullback j).map e.hom ≫ N.genericIso.hom = M.genericIso.hom`
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2, Proposition 2(a), p. 13). The proof extends each marking to the
other model by 1.3, uses `extend_inverse_model` for the inverse identities and `hom_ext` for
uniqueness. Changing either marking changes the compatibility equation, so an unmarked statement
"any two Néron models are isomorphic" is weaker and is not what later layers use. For models over
`Spec R` of a discrete valuation ring, Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.Model.subsingleton_iso` gives the
uniqueness half for any separated model; the existence half is new. *Needs:* 1.3.

### 1.5 The group law and extension of homomorphisms

Let `S` be a connected Dedekind scheme and `A` an abelian variety over `K`. Prove `GroupLaw`: the
Néron model of `A` carries a unique structure of commutative group scheme over `S` (a `GrpObj` structure
on `model` in the cartesian monoidal category `Over S`, Mathlib `CategoryTheory.Monoidal.Grp`)
extending the group law of `A`, and that every `K`-homomorphism `A → B` of abelian varieties
extends uniquely to an `S`-homomorphism of Néron models (Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2,
Proposition 6, p. 14). Products of smooth `S`-schemes are smooth, so multiplication, inverse and
identity are extensions in the sense of 1.3, and the group axioms and the compatibility of
homomorphisms follow from `hom_ext`. A generic isogeny extends to a homomorphism of models; it is
not asserted to extend to a finite flat morphism. *Needs:* 1.3, 1.4;
`AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A1` for the abelian-variety and abelian-scheme carriers over a
base and the group objects of `Over S`; Mathlib `GrpObj`, `IsCommMonObj`.

**Checks.**

- The extension of the zero homomorphism `A → B` is the zero homomorphism of models.
- The extension of the group law restricts to the group law of `A` on the generic fibre.
- A translation `x ↦ x + a` by a `K`-point `a` of `A` extends as a morphism of `S`-schemes but
  is not a homomorphism; the extension functor does not turn scheme maps into group maps.

### 1.6 Weak Néron models

Define the structure `WeakNeronModel j A`: the same carrier as 1.2 (a smooth, separated,
quasi-compact object of `Over S` with a marking) but with the extension property required only
for `Y` in `Over S` with étale structure morphism (Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale`)
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2, Definition 1, p. 12). In the arithmetic application `j` is the
generic inclusion of a discrete valuation ring, and the étale test objects are the sections over
strictly henselian base changes. A weak model need not be unique. Prove the projections
`WeakNeronModel.smooth_model`, `separated_model`, `quasiCompact_model`, the marking identities
`generic_hom_inv`, `generic_inv_hom`, the restriction lemmas `bijective`, `injective`,
`surjective`, `existsUnique` and `hom_ext` for étale `Y`, and `WeakNeronModel.ofNeronModel`
(every Néron model is a weak Néron model). *Needs:* 1.2; Mathlib `Etale`.

**Checks.**

- `structure_test` — the weak model is smooth, separated and quasi-compact.
- `etale_extension_test` — a map from an étale generic test object has exactly one marked
  extension.
- `identity_base_test` (degenerate) — for `j = 𝟙 S` every smooth separated quasi-compact `X` is
  its own weak model; as in 1.1 the degenerate base carries no arithmetic content.

### 1.7 Smoothening and local existence

Let `R` be an excellent discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K` and `A` an abelian variety
over `K`. Prove the construction `Smoothening`: properness of `A` bounds `A(K^sh)` in the sense of
Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.1, the smoothening process (blow-ups of the special fibre along the
centres where the defect is positive, with the defect strictly decreasing) produces a smooth
separated finite-type weak Néron model of `A`, and the group structure of `A` upgrades a weak
model to a model with the full mapping property by the criterion of §1.2, Criterion 9
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2, Criterion 9, p. 15; §1.3, Theorem 1 and Corollary 2,
pp. 16–17). The construction of a *group* weak model from a weak model is part of this target
(rational group law, saturation under the group law); the uniqueness and group-law results of
1.4–1.5 assume the full mapping property and cannot replace it. Bijectivity of the restriction map
on `R`-points alone does not give the mapping property. Then prove `LocalExistence`: every abelian
variety over the fraction field of an excellent discrete valuation ring has a finite-type Néron
model over that ring (Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.3, Corollary 2, p. 17). No existence is
asserted for an arbitrary smooth group (a split torus has only a locally-finite-type Néron model,
which is ReductiveGroupsPartII's object) nor for a genus-one curve without a rational point.
*Needs:* 1.5, 1.6; excellence of a ring is SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.0 §6
(catenary, Nagata and excellent rings); dilatations and blow-ups along closed subschemes of the
special fibre are SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.4c (modifications).

**Checks.**

- The construction handles a non-proper smooth test `Y` (for instance an open subscheme of the
  model itself) and positive residue characteristic; a construction verified only on proper
  generic points is not this target.
- For an abelian scheme over `R` the smoothening process stops immediately and returns the
  abelian scheme.
- For a split torus over `K` the boundedness hypothesis fails, and the construction does not
  apply; the finite-type existence statement is false for it.

### 1.8 Spreading out and the Dedekind local-to-global construction

Prove `SpreadAbelian`: for `A` over `K` and `S` connected Dedekind, there is a nonempty open
`U ⊂ S` and an abelian scheme `A_U` over `U` with generic fibre `A`; the group law, the identity
section and the smooth proper geometrically connected fibres spread out together with the scheme,
by finite presentation of the defining equations and of the group morphisms and by shrinking `U`
until the group identities and the fibre conditions hold (Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.4,
Proposition 2 and Theorem 3, pp. 18–20). The complement of `U` is a finite set of closed points. A
stalk-level spreading lemma for a single morphism (Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry/SpreadingOut.lean`)
is an input, not a substitute. Then prove `DedekindGluing`: if `A` extends to an abelian scheme over
a dense open `U ⊂ S` and has finite-type Néron models over the local rings at the finitely many
closed points outside `U`, then these glue to a finite-type `S`-model with the full mapping
property; the gluing spreads each local model and its marking to an open neighbourhood
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2, Lemma 5, pp. 13–14), uses 1.4 for the transition isomorphisms
and their cocycle condition, and checks the mapping property locally on the finite open cover
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.4, Proposition 1 and Theorem 3, pp. 18–20). Apply it to the ring
of integers and the rings of `S`-integers of a number field. *Needs:* 1.4, 1.7, 1.9;
`AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A1`; Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.OpenCover`, `Scheme.GlueData`.

**Checks.**

- Only finitely many closed points of `S` lie outside `U`.
- The localisation of the glued model at a closed point `s ∉ U` is the prescribed local model at
  `s`, and at `s ∈ U` it is the abelian scheme.
- A model glued from infinitely many local pieces, or whose mapping property was checked only at
  the generic point, is not finite type over `S` and fails the global property.

### 1.9 Abelian schemes are Néron models

Prove `AbelianSchemeModel`: an abelian scheme `𝒜` over `S` (smooth proper group scheme with
geometrically connected fibres, `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A1`) satisfies the Néron
mapping property, hence is the marked Néron model of its generic fibre
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2, Proposition 8, p. 15). The proof is the extension theorem for
rational maps from a smooth `S`-scheme into an abelian scheme (Weil's extension theorem, as cited
there), which is part of this target, followed by 1.4. Good reduction of `A` at a closed point
`s` is defined as the existence of an abelian scheme over the local ring at `s` with generic fibre
`A`; it is not the equation-level predicate of EllipticCurves, and 6.5 proves the comparison.
*Needs:* 1.4; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A1` (abelian schemes, pointed rigidity).

**Checks.**

- Over a complete discrete valuation ring an abelian scheme is proper, so its Néron model is
  proper and the component group of 2.2 is trivial.
- The Néron model of an abelian variety with good reduction is unique up to the unique marked
  isomorphism of 1.4 and coincides with any abelian-scheme model.
- A smooth proper model whose special fibre is not geometrically connected is not an abelian
  scheme, and this target says nothing about it.

### 1.10 Étale and unramified base change

Prove `EtaleBasechange`: for an étale morphism `S' → S` of Dedekind schemes, the base change of a
Néron model of `A` is the Néron model of `A ×_K K'`; in the local case this applies to an
unramified extension of discrete valuation rings (Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.2,
Proposition 2(c), p. 13). A smooth `S'`-scheme is smooth over `S`, its generic morphism extends by
the mapping property over `S`, and the structure morphism to `S'` is forced by the extension;
separatedness and finite type survive base change. Arbitrary ramified base change of the full
model is false and is not asserted; 3.4 and 3.5 give the identity-component statement that does
hold. *Needs:* 1.2, 1.4; Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.Etale`, `Smooth` (composition and base change
instances).

**Checks.**

- For `S' = S` the base change is the identity.
- For an unramified extension of discrete valuation rings the special fibre of the base-changed
  model is the base change of the special fibre; the component group of 2.2 does not change.
- (non-example) For a split Tate curve with `ord(q) = n` and a ramified extension of index `e`
  the component group becomes `ℤ/en` (3.5), so the base-changed model is not the Néron model;
  the étale hypothesis cannot be dropped.

### 1.11 The invariant-differential lattice

For the global Néron model `M` over `S` with identity section `e`, the sheaf `ω_M := e^*Ω¹_{M/S}`
and its translation invariance `Ω¹_{M/S} ≅ π^*ω_M` are SchemeAndStackFoundations T361 (invariant
differentials of a group scheme over a base); define `DifferentialLattice` as that sheaf for the
Néron model, and prove what the height theory needs of it (Yuan–Zhang, §1.1, p. 534):
`NeronDifferentials.rank` (`ω_M` is locally free of rank `g = dim A`, `S` connected),
`generic_iso` (`ω_M ⊗ K` is the space of invariant differentials of `A`), `localize` (the
localisation of `ω_M` at a closed point is the invariant-differential module of the local Néron
model), `pullback` (an extended homomorphism `f : M → N` induces `f^* : ω_N → ω_M`) with `map_id`
and `map_comp`, `det` (the determinant `det ω_M` is an invertible sheaf, the integral Hodge line)
with `det_localize`, `etale_basechange` (compatibility with the base change of 1.10) and
`affine_colie` (for `S = Spec R` and an affine open chart `U = Spec B` of `M` through the identity
section with augmentation `ε : B → R`, the conormal module `ker ε / (ker ε)²` is `ω_M`; the chart
need not be a group scheme or carry a Hopf algebra). On `S = Spec R` the module `ω_M` is a finite
projective `R`-lattice in the `K`-vector space of invariant differentials and is not asserted to
be free. *Needs:* 1.5, 1.8; SchemeAndStackFoundations T361; Mathlib `KaehlerDifferential` on
affine charts.

**Checks.**

- `zero_dimension` (degenerate) — the zero abelian variety has `ω_M = 0` and trivial Hodge line.
- `localization_test` — over a discrete valuation ring with good elliptic reduction the minimal
  invariant differential of EllipticCurves Layer 1 is a basis of `ω_M` (the comparison is 6.10).
- `projective_test` (non-example) — for `S = Spec R` with `det ω_M` of nonzero class in `Pic R`,
  the lattice `ω_M` is finite projective and not free; a definition carrying a free module would be
  wrong for such `R`.

### Examples

- Over `ℤ_p` an elliptic curve with good reduction has as Néron model the smooth proper
  Weierstrass model, which is an abelian scheme (1.9).
- Over `ℤ[1/N]` the Néron model of an abelian variety with good reduction outside `N` is an
  abelian scheme, and the Dedekind construction of 1.8 glues it with the local models at the
  primes dividing `N`.
- A split torus `𝔾_m` over `ℚ_p` has no finite-type Néron model: its locally-finite-type Néron
  model (ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.3.2) has special fibre `𝔾_m × ℤ`, which is not quasi-compact.

### Dependencies

Mathlib's scheme-morphism classes and `Over.pullback`; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A1`
for abelian schemes over a base; SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.0 §6 (excellent rings) and SF.4c
(modifications) for 1.7; ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.3.2 is a sibling, not an input: its
locally-finite-type Néron models of tori share the mapping property of 1.1 and are compared with
it there, not here.

## Layer 2: special fibres and component groups

The special fibre `M_k` of a Néron model is a smooth finite-type commutative group over `k`,
usually disconnected and usually not affine. This layer constructs its identity component, the
finite étale component group `Φ_A`, the Chevalley decomposition of the identity component into
toric, abelian and unipotent parts, and the character lattice of the toric part with its residue
Galois action; it proves functoriality under isogeny without the false exactness statements; and
for elliptic curves it compares all of this with the equation-level objects of EllipticCurves
Layer 4 and with the geometry of the minimal regular model. Throughout, `R` is a discrete
valuation ring with fraction field `K` and residue field `k`, `A` an abelian variety over `K`, and
`M` its Néron model over `R` (Layer 1); perfectness of `k` and base change to `k̄` are stated where
used.

### 2.1 The identity component

Construct `IdentityComponent`: the open and closed subgroup `M_k⁰ ⊂ M_k` whose geometric fibre is
the connected component of the identity, descended to `k`, and the open subgroup `M⁰ ⊂ M` with
generic fibre `A` and special fibre `M_k⁰` (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, §1.1, pp. 321–322). Neither group
is affine in general: for good reduction `M_k⁰ = M_k` is an abelian variety. Prove
`NeronIdentity.open` (`M_k⁰` is open and closed in `M_k`), `normal` (it is a normal subgroup,
commutative since `A` is), `contains_zero` (the identity section of `M` factors through `M⁰`),
`geometrically_connected` (`M_k⁰ ×_k k̄` is connected), `generic_iso` (the generic fibre of `M⁰`
is `A`), `basechange_field` (formation of `M_k⁰` commutes with extension of `k`), `map`,
`map_id`, `map_comp` (a homomorphism of models sends identity components to identity components,
functorially) and `good` (for an abelian-scheme model, `M⁰ = M`). The representability of the
identity component of a smooth finite-type group scheme over `k` and its descent are part of this
target; Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.FiniteTypeCommHopfAlgCat.identityComponentSpec` covers affine groups
over an algebraically closed field only, and 2.1 must agree with it in that case. *Needs:* 1.5;
Mathlib `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.fiber`, connected components of a scheme.

**Checks.**

- `good_test` — for an elliptic curve with good reduction `M_k⁰` is the whole special fibre.
- `split_tate_test` — for split multiplicative elliptic reduction with `ord(q) = n > 1`,
  `M_k⁰ = 𝔾_m` although the special fibre of the minimal regular model has `n` components; the
  identity component of the Néron model is not the special fibre of the regular model.
- `nonaffine_test` (non-example) — for a positive-dimensional abelian variety with good
  reduction, `M_k` is a proper connected smooth group of positive dimension, so it is not affine;
  a construction that assumed an affine group would not apply.

### 2.2 The component group

Construct `ComponentGroup`, written `Φ_A := M_k / M_k⁰`, as a finite étale commutative `k`-group
scheme representing the fppf quotient sheaf (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, §§1.1–1.2, pp. 322–323). The
quotient of a locally-finite-type group scheme over a field by an open normal subgroup is a
scheme by ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.3.1 (quotients over a base of dimension at most one);
finiteness and étaleness are proved here. Prove `NeronComponents.projection` (the group
morphism `M_k → Φ_A`), `kernel` (its kernel is `M_k⁰`), `quotient` (a morphism from `M_k`
constant on cosets of `M_k⁰` factors uniquely through `Φ_A`), `finite_etale`, `geometric`
(`Φ_A(k̄)` is the finite group of geometric connected components of `M_k`), `rational`
(`Φ_A(k) = Φ_A(k^sep)^{Gal(k^sep/k)}`, so the rational component group is the Galois-fixed
subgroup of the geometric one), `map`, `map_id`, `map_comp` (an extended homomorphism `A → B`
induces `Φ_A → Φ_B`, functorially) and `good` (an abelian-scheme model has `Φ_A = 0`). Where
`M_k` is affine and `k` algebraically closed, `Φ_A` agrees with Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.FiniteTypeCommHopfAlgCat.componentGroupScheme`. *Needs:* 2.1; ReductiveGroupsPartII
RG2.3.1 (quotients over a discrete valuation ring and over a field).

**Checks.**

- `good_test` (degenerate) — good reduction gives `Φ_A = 0`, not a group with one nonzero class.
- `tate_test` — for a split Tate curve with `ord(q) = n > 0`, `Φ_E(k^sep) = ℤ/n`.
- `nonsplit_test` — for `k` finite and `E` with nonsplit multiplicative reduction and geometric
  component group `ℤ/n`, residue Frobenius acts by `−1`, so `Φ_E(k)` has order `1` for odd `n`
  and `2` for even `n`, not `n`; in Lean, `ComponentGroup.card_fixedPoints_neg` with the
  instances `n = 4, 5, 1`, and `n = 0` (where `ℤ/0 = ℤ` has one fixed point while the formula
  would say `2`) as the negative control for the hypothesis `0 < n`.

### 2.3 The Chevalley decomposition of the identity fibre

Let `k` be perfect. Prove `Chevalley`: `M_k⁰` has a unique maximal smooth connected affine
subgroup `L`, with `M_k⁰ / L` an abelian variety `B`; the commutative group `L` is the product
over `k` of its maximal torus `T` and its unipotent radical `U`; record the toric rank
`t = dim T`, the abelian rank `a = dim B` and the unipotent rank `u = dim U`, with
`t + a + u = g` (Conrad, §2, Theorem 2.6, pp. 3–4; Proposition 2.16, p. 6; §3, Theorem 3.1,
pp. 7–8). The structure theorem for connected smooth groups over a perfect field is applied to
the identity component, not to the disconnected fibre, and is part of this target; over an
imperfect field the exact smooth form is not asserted, and 2.4 records what descends. Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.unipotentRadical` and `TauCeti.IsMaximalTorus` (affine groups) are the suppliers for
`U` and `T` inside `L`. *Needs:* 2.1; Tau Ceti `unipotentRadical`, `IsMaximalTorus`.

**Checks.**

- Good reduction has `t = u = 0`, `a = g`.
- Split multiplicative elliptic reduction has `t = 1`, `a = u = 0`.
- Additive elliptic reduction has `u = 1`, `t = a = 0`; a decomposition that omitted the
  unipotent part could not distinguish it from multiplicative reduction.

### 2.4 The toric character lattice

For the identity fibre `M_k⁰` with semi-abelian geometric structure, the maximal torus `T ⊂ M_k⁰`
and the abelian quotient descend to `k` even when `k` is imperfect (Conrad, Theorem 3.1 and
proof, pp. 7–8; Proposition 2.16, p. 6). Define `ToricCharacter`: the character lattice
`X^*(T) = Hom_{k^sep}(T, 𝔾_m)`, a free `ℤ`-module of rank `t` with continuous
`Gal(k^sep/k)`-action, taken from ReductiveGroups Layer 4 (character lattices of tori) and
Layer 7 (the Galois action), and in Tau Ceti `TauCeti.CommHopfAlgCat.geometricCharacterGroup`
with the anti-equivalence `TauCeti.TorusCommHopfAlgCat.characterLatticeFunctor`. Prove that a
homomorphism of Néron models `f : M_A → M_B` restricts to `f_T : T_A → T_B` and induces the
contravariant `f_T^* : X^*(T_B) → X^*(T_A)`, with `map_id` and `map_comp`, and that `X^*`
commutes with extension of `k` (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, 11.6.1, p. 456, and 10.4, p. 444). *Needs:*
2.1; ReductiveGroups Layers 4 and 7; Tau Ceti `geometricCharacterGroup`, `characterLatticeFunctor`.

**Checks.**

- For split `T = 𝔾_m`, `X^*(T) = ℤ`.
- Multiplication by `m` on `A` induces multiplication by `m` on `X^*(T_A)`.
- For a nonsplit one-dimensional torus (nonsplit multiplicative reduction) the Galois action on
  `X^* = ℤ` is by `−1`; a lattice carried without its Galois action would make the rational
  component count of 2.2 wrong.

### 2.5 Functoriality under isogeny

Prove `IsogenyComponents`: a generic isogeny `A → B` extends to a homomorphism of Néron models,
hence to homomorphisms `M_{A,k}⁰ → M_{B,k}⁰` and `Φ_A → Φ_B`; if `A` is semistable, the map of
connected special fibres is an isogeny and `B` is semistable (Conrad, Proposition 4.1 and proof,
pp. 8–9). The kernel is bounded by the finite kernel of multiplication by the degree on the
semi-abelian identity fibre, and the Chevalley decomposition is applied only after base change to
`k̄`. The extended map of models is not asserted to be finite flat, and taking Néron models does
not preserve exact sequences: Yuan–Zhang's erratum withdraws exactly that step
(Yuan–Zhang, Erratum, introduction, p. 1, citing Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, p. 190, Example 8).
*Needs:* 1.5, 2.2, 2.3.

**Checks.**

- The component map `Φ_A → Φ_B` of an isogeny has a kernel and cokernel that must be computed;
  for isogenous Tate curves with `ord(q) = n` and `ord(q') = mn` the map `ℤ/n → ℤ/mn` is
  neither surjective nor zero.
- For an isogeny between abelian varieties with good reduction the induced map of abelian
  special fibres is an isogeny of abelian varieties over `k`.
- (non-example) A short exact sequence `0 → A' → A → A'' → 0` of abelian varieties does not give
  an exact sequence of Néron models or of component groups; a lemma asserting it would be false.

### 2.6 The elliptic reduction filtration

Let `R` be complete with perfect residue field `k` and `E` an elliptic curve over `K`. Prove
`EllipticFiltration`: the equation-level subgroup `E₀(K)` of points with nonsingular reduction
(EllipticCurves Layer 4) is `M⁰(R)`, and the kernel of reduction `E₁(K)` (EllipticCurves
Layer 4; Tau Ceti `kerReduction`, with `formalPointAddEquivKerReduction` identifying it with the
formal group on the maximal ideal) is the kernel of `M⁰(R) → M_k⁰(k)`; and for finite `k`,
`E(K)/E₀(K) ≅ Φ_E(k)` (Tate, §4, Theorems 4.1–4.2 and §6, pp. 41–46). The comparison of sections
uses smooth lifting over the complete base and the mapping property; for finite `k` the
surjectivity of `M⁰(R) → M_k⁰(k)` on the identity component uses `H¹(k, M_k⁰) = 0` (Lang's
theorem for connected smooth groups over a finite field), which is part of this target. Over an
arbitrary residue field the rational lifting obstruction is retained and `E(K)/E₀(K) → Φ_E(k)`
is only injective. *Needs:* 2.1, 2.2; EllipticCurves Layers 1 and 4; Tau Ceti `kerReduction`,
`formalPointAddEquivKerReduction`.

**Checks.**

- For good reduction over a complete ring with finite residue field, `E(K) = E₀(K)` and
  `Φ_E(k) = 0`.
- For nonsplit multiplicative reduction the order of `E(K)/E₀(K)` is `1` or `2`, not the
  geometric component count.
- The identification `E₁(K) = ker(M⁰(R) → M_k⁰(k))` matches Tau Ceti's `kerReduction`.

### 2.7 The smooth locus of the minimal regular model

Let `R` be strictly henselian with algebraically closed residue field, `E` an elliptic curve
over `K` and `X` its minimal proper regular model over `R` (StableReduction Layer 5). Prove
`MinimalRegularSmoothLocus`: the relative smooth locus `X_sm ⊂ X` is the Néron model of `E`
(Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.5, Proposition 1, p. 21). Properness of `X` gives the extension
of sections, translation by sections and the minimality of `ω` upgrade this to the full mapping
property; the existence of `X` is imported, and the excellent-DVR existence theorem of 1.7 is not
needed. *Needs:* 1.1; StableReduction Layer 5 (regular and minimal models of a pointed
genus-one curve).

**Checks.**

- A component of multiplicity greater than one lies outside `X_sm`.
- For good reduction `X_sm = X` is the smooth proper model.
- The generic fibre of `X_sm` is `E`, and the zero section lies in `X_sm`.

### 2.8 The geometric Kodaira configurations

Under the hypotheses of 2.7, attach to each value of EllipticCurves' `ReductionSymbol`
(`I₀, Iₙ, II, III, IV, I₀*, Iₙ*, IV*, III*, II*`) the geometry of the special fibre `X_k`: its
reduced irreducible components, their singularities, intersections and multiplicities, and prove
`KodairaGeometricConfigurations` (Tate, §6, geometric rows of the table, p. 46, which lie above
the characteristic restriction and so hold in every residue characteristic). Explicitly: `I₀` is a
smooth genus-one curve; `I₁` a nodal rational curve; `II` a cuspidal rational curve; `Iₙ`
(`n ≥ 2`) a cycle of `n` smooth rational curves, with two intersection points for `n = 2`; `III`
two smooth rational curves tangent at one point; `IV` three smooth rational curves through one
point; `I₀*` the affine `D̃₄` configuration with central multiplicity `2` and four ends of
multiplicity `1`; `Iₙ*` four ends of multiplicity `1` and `n + 1` inner components of
multiplicity `2`; `IV*`, `III*`, `II*` the affine `Ẽ₆`, `Ẽ₇`, `Ẽ₈` configurations with
multiplicity multisets `{1,1,1,2,2,2,3}`, `{1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4}`, `{1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,6}`. The number
`m` of geometric irreducible components is `1` for `I₀, I₁, II`; `n` for `Iₙ`; `2` for `III`;
`3` for `IV`; `5` for `I₀*`; `n + 5` for `Iₙ*`; `7, 8, 9` for `IV*, III*, II*`. StableReduction
Layer 5 supplies the minimal regular model with its components, multiplicities, intersection
relations and genus formula, and Layer 4 the resolution by blow-ups; StableReduction's
introduction assigns the geometric meaning of the reduction symbol to that roadmap without listing
it as a target, and this roadmap states the dictionary. Numerical types (StableReduction
Layer 6) are a consequence, not the classifier: `I₀`, `I₁` and `II` have the same numerical type.
*Needs:* 2.7; EllipticCurves Layer 4 (`ReductionSymbol`, Tate's algorithm); StableReduction
Layers 4–6.

**Checks.**

- `I₀`, `I₁` and `II` each have one component but different normalisations and singularities;
  a classifier reading only the intersection matrix cannot separate them.
- `I₂` has two components meeting in two points: the dual graph has a double edge, not a simple
  edge.
- `I₀*` has five components and `IV*`, `III*`, `II*` have `7`, `8`, `9`; the count `m` alone
  does not determine the type, and it is the count EllipticCurves Layer 4 uses in its
  algorithmic exponent `v(Δ) − m + 1`.

### 2.9 Geometric component groups by type

Under the hypotheses of 2.7, prove `KodairaComponentGroups`: `Φ_E(k̄)` is `0` for `I₀`, `ℤ/n`
for `Iₙ`, `0` for `II` and `II*`, `ℤ/2` for `III` and `III*`, `ℤ/3` for `IV` and `IV*`, `(ℤ/2)²`
for `Iₙ*` with `n` even and `ℤ/4` for `Iₙ*` with `n` odd (Tate, §6, component-group row,
p. 46). The group law on the multiplicity-one components meeting `X_sm` is computed from the
smooth-locus group of 2.7; the orders agree with the torsion of StableReduction Layer 6's
numerical Picard group of the fibre, and the group structure is determined here. These are
geometric groups; rational component groups need the Galois action of 2.2. *Needs:* 2.2, 2.8;
StableReduction Layer 6.

**Checks.**

- `I₀*` has group `(ℤ/2)²` although the fibre has five components.
- `I₁` has trivial component group although the fibre is singular.
- `I₃*` has group `ℤ/4`, not `(ℤ/2)²`: the parity of `n` matters.

### 2.10 Wild primes in the elliptic comparison

Prove `WildKodairaComparison`: the dictionary of 2.8 and the groups of 2.9 are stated for every
residue characteristic, including `2` and `3`, with the reduction symbol produced by the full
Tate algorithm of EllipticCurves Layer 4; the tame discriminant valuations (`II: 2`, `III: 3`,
`IV: 4`, `I₀*: 6`, `Iₙ*: n + 6`, `IV*: 8`, `III*: 9`, `II*: 10`) and the tame additive conductor
value `2` are consequences only when `char k ≠ 2, 3` and are not copied into the wild cases
(Tate, §6, the restriction below the table and §7, pp. 46–52). *Needs:* 2.8, 2.9; EllipticCurves
Layer 4.

**Checks.**

- For `char k = 2` an additive curve of type `II*` can have `v(Δ_min) > 10`; the tame value
  `10` would be wrong.
- For `char k = 3` type `IV` can have `v(Δ_min) > 4`.
- For `char k ≥ 5` the tame table applies and gives the discriminant valuations above.

### Examples

- `X₀(11)` over `ℚ_{11}`: split multiplicative, `Φ(k̄) = ℤ/5`, `Φ(𝔽_{11}) = ℤ/5`.
- The curve `y² = x³ − x² − 10x − 20` (`11a1`) has `I₅` at `11`; the curve `y² + y = x³ − x²`
  (`11a3`) has `I₁` at `11`, trivial component group, and is isogenous to it (2.5).
- An elliptic curve with nonsplit `I₂` reduction over `𝔽_p` has `Φ(k̄) = ℤ/2` and
  `Φ(𝔽_p) = ℤ/2`; with nonsplit `I₃` it has `Φ(𝔽_p) = 0`.

### Dependencies

Layers 1 and 4; StableReduction Layers 4–6; Tau Ceti's affine identity components and component
groups, character lattices, `kerReduction` and `formalPointAddEquivKerReduction`.

## Layer 3: semistable reduction and uniformisation

Semistability is a property of the identity component of the special fibre: it is semi-abelian.
This layer defines the predicate, proves what survives isogeny and base change, builds the
toric–finite filtration of the Tate module and Grothendieck's monodromy criterion, proves
semistable reduction after a finite extension, and compares the formal completion of the
semistable identity model with the Raynaud extension and the rigid uniformisation. Throughout,
`R` is a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K` and residue field `k`, `A` an abelian
variety over `K` with Néron model `M` (Layer 1), identity model `M⁰` and component group `Φ_A`
(Layer 2); henselian, complete and residue-characteristic hypotheses are stated where used.

### 3.1 The semistable reduction predicate

Define `SemistableReduction R A`: the identity component `M_k⁰` of the special fibre of the Néron
model is a semi-abelian variety over `k`, that is, there is a torus `T ⊂ M_k⁰` (the canonical
maximal torus of 2.4) with `M_k⁰ / T` an abelian variety (Conrad, §3, definition before
Theorem 3.1, pp. 6–7, and §4, p. 9). The predicate is applied to the identity component, not to
the whole fibre, and it is a condition over the actual residue field `k`: by 2.4 the torus and the
abelian quotient descend to `k` even when `k` is imperfect. Prove `SemistableReduction.iff_identity`
(the predicate is equivalent to the identity special fibre being semi-abelian), `good` (good
reduction, an abelian-scheme model as in 1.9, implies semistability), `no_unipotent` (over perfect
`k`, semistability is equivalent to the vanishing of the unipotent part in the Chevalley
decomposition of 2.3), `dimension` (for semistable `A` of dimension `g` with toric rank `t` and
abelian rank `a`, `g = t + a`), `isogeny` (3.2), `dual` (`A` is semistable if and only if its
dual is), `finite_basechange` (3.4), `identity_basechange` (3.4), `toric_zero` (for semistable
`A`, toric rank zero is equivalent to good reduction) and `product` (a product is semistable if
and only if both factors are, via the product model and its connected special fibre). Good
reduction is not a consequence of semistability; it requires the abelian-scheme model of 1.9.
*Needs:* 2.1, 2.3, 2.4; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3` for the dual abelian
variety.

**Checks.**

- `good_test` — an elliptic curve with good reduction is semistable with `t = 0`, `a = 1`.
- `tate_test` — a split Tate curve is semistable with `t = 1`, `a = 0`, and is not good.
- `additive_test` (non-example) — an elliptic curve with additive reduction has identity fibre
  `𝔾_a` over `k̄`, which is not semi-abelian; a predicate that only asked for a torus inside the
  fibre would wrongly accept it.

### 3.2 Semistability under isogeny

Prove `SemistabilityIsogeny`: for isogenous abelian varieties `A, B` over `K`, `A` is semistable
over `R` if and only if `B` is; their toric and abelian ranks agree, and the induced map of
connected special fibres `M_{A,k}⁰ → M_{B,k}⁰` is an isogeny (Conrad, Proposition 4.1 and its
proof, pp. 8–9). The proof is 2.5 together with the comparison of dimensions of the smooth
connected special fibres and a quasi-inverse up to multiplication by the degree. No statement
about the component groups is made: a generic isogeny of Tate curves changes `ord(q)` and hence
the order of `Φ`. *Needs:* 2.5, 3.1.

**Checks.**

- Multiplication by `n` on `A` preserves semistability and both ranks.
- Isogenous Tate curves with parameters `q` and `q^n` are both semistable with `t = 1`; their
  component groups have orders `ord(q)` and `n·ord(q)`.
- A statement claiming equal component groups for isogenous semistable varieties is refuted by
  the previous item.

### 3.3 Semistable identity models and finite base change

Prove `SemistableIdentityBasechange`: for semistable `A` over `K`, a finite extension of discrete
valuation rings `R → R'` with fraction fields `K'/K`, and `N` the Néron model of `A ×_K K'` over
`R'`, the canonical map `M⁰ ×_R R' → N⁰` is an isomorphism (Conrad, Theorem 4.4 and its proof,
pp. 10–16; Corollary 4.5, pp. 11–12). The proof shows that the base-changed semi-abelian identity
model maps by an open immersion into `N` (Zariski's main theorem, smooth and étale lifting, and
the density of integral sections, all part of this target), and that its image is exactly `N⁰`
because it contains the whole connected identity fibre and the whole generic fibre. Neither
identity model has the full mapping property, so the uniqueness of 1.4 cannot replace this
argument. The full Néron model `M ×_R R'` is not asserted to be `N`. *Needs:* 2.1, 3.1;
SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.0 §7 and SF.4c for Zariski's main theorem and the smooth and étale
lifting used in the open-immersion step.

**Checks.**

- For good reduction the base change of the abelian scheme is the abelian scheme over `R'`, and
  the statement reduces to 1.10 without the étale hypothesis.
- For a split Tate curve with `ord(q) = n` and ramification index `e`, the identity fibre stays
  `𝔾_m` while the component group becomes `ℤ/en` (3.5).
- (non-example) For an elliptic curve with additive reduction that acquires good reduction over
  `K'`, the identity fibres are `𝔾_a` and an elliptic curve; the map of identity models is not an
  isomorphism, so the semistability hypothesis cannot be dropped.

### 3.4 Ramified base change of a Tate curve

Prove `RamifiedTateCounterexample`: for a split Tate curve `E_q` over a complete discrete
valuation ring with `ord(q) = n > 0`, the geometric component group is `ℤ/n`; after a base change
of ramification index `e` it is `ℤ/en`, and the canonical component map `ℤ/n → ℤ/en` sends `r`
to `er` (Conrad, Example 4.6, pp. 11–12). The computation uses the point uniformisation
`E_q(K) = K^×/q^ℤ` of EllipticCurves Layer 4 and reads the component of a point off the valuation
of a representative modulo `ord(q)`, through 2.6. In particular the full Néron model does not
commute with ramified base change. In Lean the map is `RamifiedTate.componentMap n e`, with
`componentMap_apply` and `componentMap_injective` for `e > 0`. *Needs:* 2.2, 2.6, 3.3;
EllipticCurves Layer 4 (the Tate curve and its point uniformisation).

**Checks.**

- For `n = 1`, `e = 2` the old component group is trivial and the new one is `ℤ/2`, with the
  identity torus unchanged.
- For `e = 1` the component map is the identity.
- The component map is injective for `e > 0` and, for `e > 1` and `n > 0`, not surjective;
  for `e = 0` it is the zero map `ℤ/2 → ℤ`, not injective (negative control for `0 < e`).

### 3.5 The toric–finite filtration of the Tate module

Let `R` be henselian, `A` semistable, and `ℓ` a prime different from the characteristic of `K`.
Prove `ToricFiniteFiltration`: there are saturated `Gal(K̄/K)`-stable submodules
`T_t ⊂ T_f ⊂ T_ℓ(A)` with `T_t` of rank `t` and `T_f` of rank `t + 2a`, so that `T_ℓ(A)/T_f` has
rank `t`; `T_f` is the Tate module of the finite part of the `ℓ`-power torsion of the Néron model
(the torsion of `M⁰` lifted through the henselian quasi-finite decomposition) and `T_t` the Tate
module of the toric part (Conrad, Lemma 5.4 and the preceding definitions, pp. 17–18). If moreover
`ℓ ≠ char k`, then `T_f` is the submodule of inertia invariants; at `ℓ = char k` this
identification is not asserted and the finite part is described by the finite flat torsion. The
printed corank `2g − (2t + a)` in the source is a misprint for `2g − (t + 2a) = t`. *Needs:* 3.1;
`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6` (Tate modules of abelian varieties with their Galois
action and isogeny compatibility); `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3` (finite flat torsion
subgroup schemes).

**Checks.**

- For a split Tate curve (`g = t = 1`, `a = 0`) the finite part has rank one and the quotient
  rank one; a corank of zero would be wrong.
- For good reduction `T_t = 0` and `T_f = T_ℓ(A)`.
- For an abelian surface with `t = 1`, `a = 1` the ranks are `1 ⊂ 3 ⊂ 4`.

### 3.6 Weil orthogonality

Under the hypotheses of 3.5, prove `Orthogonality`: for the Weil pairing
`T_ℓ(A) × T_ℓ(A^∨) → ℤ_ℓ(1)`, the finite part `T_f(A)` is the exact annihilator of the toric part
`T_t(A^∨)`, and `T_ℓ(A)/T_f(A)` is dual to `T_t(A^∨)` with the Tate twist (Conrad, Theorem 5.5 and
proof, pp. 18–20). For `ℓ = char k` in mixed characteristic the proof uses the full faithfulness
of the generic fibre functor on `p`-divisible groups over `R` and Cartier duality, which is part
of this target; it does not use inertia invariants at the residue prime. *Needs:* 3.5;
`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6` and `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3` for the
integral Weil pairing with its dual and Tate twist.

**Checks.**

- The ranks satisfy `rk T_f(A) + rk T_t(A^∨) = 2g`.
- For a principally polarised `A` the pairing identifies `T_ℓ(A)/T_f` with the dual of `T_t`.
- Saturation and the Tate twist are kept before reducing modulo `ℓ`: the reduction of `T_f` is
  the finite part of `A[ℓ]`, not merely a subspace of the same dimension.

### 3.7 Unipotence of inertia of exponent two

Under the hypotheses of 3.5 with `ℓ ≠ char k`, prove `InertiaSquareZero`: every element `σ` of
the inertia group acts on `T_ℓ(A)` with `(σ − 1)² = 0`, and `σ − 1` factors through the toric
part (Conrad, Remark 5.6, p. 18). Inertia fixes `T_f` by 3.5 and acts trivially on the quotient
by 3.6, so `σ − 1` maps `T_ℓ(A)` into `T_f` and kills `T_f`. *Needs:* 3.5, 3.6.

**Checks.**

- For a Tate curve `σ − 1` is nonzero on `T_ℓ` but has square zero; semisimplifying the
  representation loses this datum.
- For good reduction `σ − 1 = 0`.
- The image of `σ − 1` lies in `T_t`, not merely in `T_f`.

### 3.8 Grothendieck's monodromy criterion

Let `R` be henselian and `ℓ ≠ char k`. Prove `MonodromyCriterion`: `A` is semistable over `R` if
and only if inertia acts unipotently on `T_ℓ(A)`, and in that case with exponent at most two
(Conrad, Theorem 5.8 and proof, pp. 20–22; SGA 7 I, Exposé IX). The forward direction is 3.7. The
converse is a geometric theorem: from a unipotent inertia action one descends the saturated
inertia-invariant sub-Tate-module, together with its compatible system of divisible torsion
subgroups, to a semi-abelian subgroup of the identity fibre; the step "equal rational fixed spaces
give equal `A[ℓⁿ](K)` and `A[ℓⁿ](K')` at every level" that the source prints at p. 21 is not valid
(on `ℤ_ℓ²` the matrices `[[1, ℓ], [0, 1]]` and its `ℓ`-th power have the same rational fixed line
but different fixed points modulo `ℓ²`), and the correct integral descent of the divisible
subsystem is part of this target. The proof order must also be independent of 3.9: the source
proves the criterion assuming potential semistability, so the converse here is established
directly, or through the curve-and-Picard route of Layer 4 for Jacobians followed by descent.
*Needs:* 3.7; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6`.

**Checks.**

- No criterion of this form holds at `ℓ = char k`; the statement carries `ℓ ≠ char k`.
- Triviality of inertia on `A[ℓ]` alone does not give semistability (3.10 needs `N ≥ 3`).
- For a Tate curve the criterion holds with the unipotent operator of 3.7, exponent exactly two.

### 3.9 Semistable reduction after a finite separable extension

Let `R` be an excellent discrete valuation ring. Prove `FiniteSeparableSemistableExtension`: there
is a finite separable extension `K'/K` such that `A ×_K K'` is semistable at every discrete
valuation ring of the integral closure of `R` in `K'` lying over `R` (Conrad, Theorem 4.2 and
Lemma 4.3, pp. 9–10; §7, pp. 24–35). Quasi-unipotence of the inertia action
(`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`) gives an open subgroup of inertia acting unipotently;
its fixed field is separable, and 3.8 applies at each valuation after passing to the
henselisation. The integral closure of an excellent `R` in `K'` is finite over `R` and semilocal,
so every prime above `R` is checked; this finiteness and the descent of semistability from the
henselisation are part of this target. *Needs:* 3.8; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`;
SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.0 §5–§6 (henselisation, excellence and finiteness of integral closure).

**Checks.**

- The extension is separable; a purely inseparable extension does not change the inertia action
  on `T_ℓ` and would not help.
- For an elliptic curve with additive reduction and `j ∈ R`, a finite extension gives good
  reduction; the theorem asserts only semistability.
- For a non-henselian `R` with two primes above it in `K'`, semistability is checked at both.

### 3.10 Full level forces semistability

Let `N ≥ 3` be invertible in `k`. Prove `FiniteTorsionSemistability`: if inertia acts trivially on
`A[N](K^sep)`, then `A` is semistable over `R`; in particular `A` acquires semistable reduction at
every place not dividing `N` after adjoining its `N`-torsion (Conrad, Proposition 6.5 and proof,
pp. 23–24). By quasi-unipotence some power of each inertia matrix is unipotent; the congruence to
the identity modulo `N` bounds every eigenvalue in the valuation ring of `Q̄_ℓ` (in `1 + ℓ𝒪` at an
odd prime `ℓ ∣ N`, in `1 + 4𝒪` for `ℓ = 2`), no nontrivial root of unity satisfies the bound, so
the eigenvalues are `1` and 3.8 applies. The integral matrix argument at level `N` is part of
this target; torsion-freeness of a group of scalar units is not the argument. No good reduction is
claimed. *Needs:* 3.8; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`, `R01.6`.

**Checks.**

- `N = 2` is excluded (non-example): the quadratic twist of an elliptic curve with good
  reduction by a ramified quadratic character has additive reduction, yet inertia acts on its
  `2`-torsion through `−1 ≡ 1`, trivially; the eigenvalue bound `1 + 2𝒪` admits `−1`, and the
  conclusion is false for `N = 2`.
- A Tate curve with `N ∣ ord(q)` has unramified `N`-torsion and is semistable but not good.
- For `A` with good reduction the hypothesis holds for every `N` prime to `char k`.

### 3.11 The Raynaud extension

Let `R` be complete with `char k > 0` and `A` semistable. Prove `RaynaudExtensionComparison`: the
maximal torus `T` of the special fibre `M_k⁰` lifts uniquely to a formal torus `𝒯` in the formal
completion `M̂⁰` of the identity model along its special fibre, the quotient `M̂⁰/𝒯` is a formal
abelian scheme `ℬ̂`, and the extension `0 → 𝒯 → M̂⁰ → ℬ̂ → 0` algebraises to an extension
`0 → T_R → G → B → 0` of an abelian scheme `B` over `R` by a torus `T_R` over `R`, the Raynaud
extension of `A` (Raynaud 1994, §4.2 (i)–(iv), pp. 302–303; Theorem 4.2.2, p. 304;
Definition 4.2.3, p. 305). The formal completion, the lifting of tori and abelian schemes along
nilpotent thickenings, and the algebraisation theorem are SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.4b
inputs; the comparison between `M̂⁰` and `Ĝ` is the content here. The generic fibre of `G` is
not `A`, and no rigid generic fibre is assumed. *Needs:* 2.4, 3.1; SchemeAndStackFoundations
SF.4b (formal schemes, formal completion, algebraisation).

**Checks.**

- For good reduction `T = 0` and `G = B` is the abelian scheme.
- For a split Tate curve `G = 𝔾_m` over `R` and `B = 0`.
- The comparison concerns the identity model only: the component group of `M` is invisible in
  `M̂⁰`, and a statement identifying `Ĝ` with the completion of the full model is false whenever
  `Φ_A ≠ 0`.

### 3.12 Polarised uniformisation

Under the hypotheses of 3.11, prove `RigidUniformisation`: the rigid analytic space `A^an` is the
quotient of `G^an` by an étale-locally-constant lattice `Y` of rank `t`, that is, there is an
exact sequence `0 → Y → G^an → A^an → 0` of rigid analytic groups, and the strict `1`-motive
`[Y → G]` has `A` as its generic realisation (Raynaud 1994, §4.2 (i)–(iv) and Theorem 4.2.2,
pp. 302–304; §4.3, pp. 308–309). For a polarisation `λ : A → A^∨`, the induced map
`Y → X^*(T)` and the trivialisation of the pulled-back Poincaré biextension give an integral
pairing on `Y × Y` (the valuation of the Poincaré trivialisation) that is symmetric and positive
definite (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, Theorem 10.4(b), p. 444). When the torus is not split, `Y` is a
Galois lattice and the statement is obtained by descent; a chosen constant split lattice is not
the general case. The rigid-analytic quotient and the lattice are the Bosch–Lütkebohmert
uniformisation inputs cited by Raynaud; they are part of this target, together with the
positivity of the polarised pairing, which §4.7 of the source does not prove. *Needs:* 2.4,
3.11; AdicSpaces (the rigid generic fibre of a formal scheme is AdicSpacesPartII:F0 material
used through 3.11); the `1`-motive carrier `[Y → G]` and its dual are defined here as data, not
imported.

**Checks.**

- For a split Tate curve `Y = q^ℤ ⊂ 𝔾_m^an` has rank one and the pairing is `ord(q)`.
- For good reduction `Y = 0` and `A^an = B^an`.
- For a nonsplit torus the lattice `Y` is not constant: its Galois action is nontrivial, and a
  construction with a constant lattice would give the wrong abelian variety.

### Examples

- An elliptic curve with multiplicative reduction becomes split after an unramified quadratic
  extension and is semistable before and after (3.1, 3.3).
- The Jacobian of a curve with a regular semistable model is semistable (Layer 4) with toric
  rank the first Betti number of the dual graph (4.3), giving the ranks of 3.5 directly.
- The elliptic curve `y² = x³ + p` over `ℚ_p` (`p ≥ 5`) has additive reduction, unipotent
  inertia only after adjoining a sixth root of `p`, and good reduction there (3.9).

## Layer 4: Picard schemes of semistable curves and the monodromy pairing

For a Jacobian the Néron model is computed by the Picard functor of a regular semistable model,
and the toric part, the monodromy pairing and the component group are read off the dual graph of
the special fibre. This layer builds the degree-zero Picard scheme of a semistable curve and its
normalisation sequence, identifies the toric character lattice with the integral first homology
of the dual graph, constructs Grothendieck's integral monodromy pairing for any semistable
abelian variety, derives the component group and Grothendieck's pairing on it, proves the
intersection-matrix description, treats the one-node hyperelliptic curves of Bhargava–Gross–Wang,
and states the semi-abelian Picard scheme of a stable family. The standing hypotheses for the
curve statements are: `R` a strictly henselian discrete valuation ring with algebraically closed
residue field `k`, `X` a proper flat regular curve over `R` with geometrically connected smooth
generic fibre `X_K` and geometrically reduced nodal special fibre `X_k`; projectivity and a
section are added where used. The pairing statements are for any semistable abelian variety
over a henselian `R`.

### 4.1 The degree-zero Picard scheme of a semistable curve

Starting from the relative Picard fppf sheaf `Pic_{X/R}` of `AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry`
(T527 relative Picard sheaf, T539 representability by an algebraic space when
`𝒪_R ≅ f_*𝒪_X` universally, T543 the open subgroup `Pic^τ` and over a field its identity
component), construct `PicardZero`, written `Pic⁰_{X/R}`: the open subgroup of `Pic_{X/R}` whose
fibres are the identity components, so that its special fibre parametrises line-bundle classes of
degree zero on every irreducible component of `X_k̄`. Prove `SemistablePicard.generic` (the generic
fibre is `Jac(X_K)`), `special` (the special fibre is `Pic⁰` of `X_k`), `multidegree` (a geometric
class in the identity component has degree zero on each normalisation component), `smooth`,
`separated` (under the regularity and reduced-nodal hypotheses the identity component is
separated), `semiabelian` (each fibre is an extension of an abelian variety by a torus),
`pullback`, `pullback_id`, `pullback_comp` (contravariant functoriality for morphisms of curves
respecting multidegree zero) and `smooth_case` (for a smooth proper family the construction is the
relative Jacobian of JacobianChallenge Layer D over a field, and over `R` the abelian scheme of
`AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A2`, not a second definition) (Conrad, Theorem 7.12 (Artin),
Theorem 7.13 (Raynaud), Proposition 7.14, pp. 34–35). The non-separated relative Picard functor
itself is not a Néron model. *Needs:* AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry T527, T539, T543;
JacobianChallenge Layer D; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A2`.

**Checks.**

- `smooth_test` — for a smooth special fibre `Pic⁰_{X/R}` has no toric part and its special fibre
  is the Jacobian of `X_k`.
- `irreducible_node_test` — an irreducible rational curve with one node has `Pic⁰ = 𝔾_m`, not `0`.
- `tree_test` (degenerate) — a nodal tree of rational curves has `Pic⁰ = 0` although each
  component has nontrivial Picard group; the multidegree condition kills everything.

### 4.2 The normalisation sequence

For a proper connected nodal curve `C` over an algebraically closed field `k` with normalisation
components `C_v` (StableReduction Layer 1: normalisation, nodes, branches), prove
`NormalizationExactSequence`: there is an exact sequence of fppf group schemes

```text
0 → T_Γ → Pic⁰(C) → ∏_v Jac(C_v) → 0,
```

where `T_Γ` is a torus whose character lattice is `H₁(Γ, ℤ)` for the dual multigraph `Γ` of `C`
(loops and parallel edges retained) (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, 12.3, formulas 12.3.1–12.3.14,
pp. 469–473). The proof takes cohomology of the units sequence of the normalisation, separates
constant functions from the gluing scalars at the nodes, and identifies the quotient of the node
scalars by the vertex rescalings with `T_Γ`; the fppf cohomology of the units sequence and the
representability of the torus are part of this target. *Needs:* 4.1; StableReduction Layer 1.

**Checks.**

- For one rational curve with one node, `H₁ = ℤ` and `Pic⁰ = 𝔾_m`.
- For a tree of rational curves `H₁ = 0` and `Pic⁰ = 0`.
- For two rational curves meeting in two points `H₁ = ℤ` and `Pic⁰ = 𝔾_m`; a simple-graph
  model with one edge would give `0`.

### 4.3 Characters are integral graph cycles

For a finite multigraph `Γ` with vertex set `V`, edge set `E` and source and target maps
`src, tgt : E → V` (an orientation of StableReduction Layer 1's dual graph, whose `endpoint`
function gives the two ends of each edge), define `DualGraph.boundary src tgt`, the map
`ℤ^E → ℤ^V`, `e ↦ tgt(e) − src(e)`, and the cycle lattice
`DualGraph.cycleLattice src tgt := ker ∂ = H₁(Γ, ℤ)`; StableReduction records only the Betti
number `b₁`, and the integral lattice with its boundary map is built here. Prove
`CharactersGraphHomology`: `X^*(T_Γ) ≅ H₁(Γ, ℤ)` canonically, the isomorphism changes by the
corresponding sign when an edge is reversed, and it is equivariant for automorphisms of `C` and
for Galois descent; the dual lattice `Hom(X^*(T_Γ), ℤ)` is `H¹(Γ, ℤ)`, not `H₁` (SGA 7 I,
Exposé IX, 12.3.7 and 12.3.11–12.3.14, pp. 472–473). Prove `finrank_cycleLattice`: for connected
`Γ` with nonempty vertex set, `rank H₁ + #V = #E + 1`, agreeing with StableReduction's
`firstBetti`; two vertices with no edge refute the formula, so connectedness is needed. *Needs:* 2.4, 4.2;
StableReduction Layer 1 (`DualGraph`, `firstBetti`); Mathlib `Finsupp.linearCombination`,
`LinearMap.ker`.

**Checks.**

- A single loop has zero boundary and cycle lattice of rank `1`.
- Two vertices joined by one edge (a tree) have cycle lattice `0`.
- Two vertices joined by two parallel edges have cycle lattice of rank `1`; a simple graph on
  the same vertex set would give rank `0`.
- (non-example) Two vertices and no edge: rank `0`, and `0 + 2 ≠ 0 + 1`; the Betti formula
  needs connectedness.

### 4.4 The Picard identity component is the Néron identity component

Under the standing curve hypotheses, prove `PicardNeronIdentity`: `Pic⁰_{X/R}` is canonically the
identity open subgroup `N⁰` of the Néron model `N` of `Jac(X_K)`, and `N` itself is the
degree-zero part of the quotient of `Pic_{X/R}` by the closure of the generic identity section
(SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, Theorem 12.1(a)–(d), pp. 465–467; 12.1.11, p. 468). The quotient `P/E` of the
relative Picard functor by the subgroup generated by the vertical divisors is shown to have the
mapping property first (so that 1.4 applies to it and to `N`), and the comparison is then
restricted to identity components; `Pic⁰_{X/R}` alone has no full mapping property when `Φ ≠ 0`.
Representability of the quotient and separatedness under the reduced-nodal hypothesis are part
of this target. *Needs:* 1.4, 4.1.

**Checks.**

- For a split `Iₙ` model, `Pic⁰_{X/R}` has special fibre `𝔾_m` while `N` has `n` geometric
  components.
- For a smooth model `Pic⁰_{X/R} = N` is the abelian scheme.
- The quotient `P/E` and not `Pic⁰_{X/R}` is the full Néron model: a statement giving
  `Pic⁰_{X/R}` the mapping property is refuted by the `Iₙ` case.

### 4.5 The integral monodromy pairing

Let `R` be henselian and `A` semistable, with toric character lattices `X_A := X^*(T_A)` and
`X_{A^∨} := X^*(T_{A^∨})` (2.4 applied to `A` and its dual). Construct
`IntegralMonodromyPairing`, the bilinear map `u : X_{A^∨} × X_A → ℤ` obtained from the valuation
of the trivialisation of the Poincaré biextension on the Raynaud extensions (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX,
Theorem 10.4, p. 444; the construction is over the henselian trait, from the dual and Poincaré
data, and the analytic uniformisation of 3.12 is a comparison, not the construction). Prove
`NeronMonodromy.bilinear`, `adjoint` (`u♯ : X_{A^∨} → Hom(X_A, ℤ)`), `non_degenerate` (`u♯` is
injective with finite cokernel), `dual_symmetry` (the pairing of `A^∨` is the transpose of that
of `A` under biduality), `polarized_symmetric` and `polarized_positive` (for a polarisation
`λ : A → A^∨`, `(x, y) ↦ u(λ^* x, y)` on `X_A` is symmetric and positive definite over `ℝ`; no
integral unimodularity is asserted), `prime_adic` (`u ⊗ ℤ_ℓ` is the `ℓ`-adic monodromy pairing
for every prime `ℓ`, with the `p`-divisible-group construction at the residue prime),
`basechange` (a base change of ramification index `e` multiplies `u` by `e` under the identity
torus comparison of 3.3), `functorial` (for `f : A → B`, `y ∈ X_{A^∨}` and `x ∈ X_B`,
`u_A(y, f^* x) = u_B((f^∨)^* y, x)`) and `zero_torus` (zero lattices give the zero pairing with
zero cokernel). In Lean, the lattice-level objects are `LatticePairing.adjoint`,
`componentGroup` (the cokernel of `u♯`) and `rankOne n`, the pairing `(y, x) ↦ n·x·y` on
`ℤ × ℤ`. *Needs:* 2.4, 3.11; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3` (dual abelian variety,
Poincaré biextension); the dual `1`-motive data of 3.12.

**Checks.**

- `tate_test` — for a split Tate curve with `ord(q) = n`, the self-dual rank-one pairing is
  multiplication by `n`.
- `ramification_test` — a base change of ramification index `e` changes the Tate pairing from
  `n` to `en`.
- `good_test` (degenerate) — good reduction has zero lattices and the zero pairing, not a
  positive-rank pairing.

### 4.6 The graph formula for the monodromy pairing of a Jacobian

Under the standing curve hypotheses with `X` projective, prove `GraphMonodromy`: under the
autoduality of the Jacobian and the isomorphism of 4.3, the pairing `u` on `H₁(Γ, ℤ)` is
`u(c, d) = Σ_e c_e d_e`, the edge form with all edge lengths `1`; reversing an edge changes the
sign of both coordinates and preserves the form (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, 12.4–12.5, pp. 473–475).
For a stable model whose node is `xy = π^m` with `m > 1` the regular resolution replaces the
node by a chain of `m − 1` rational curves, and the formula holds with edge length `m`; this
weighted form is derived through the subdivision comparison with the regular model
(StableReduction Layer 4). In Lean the weighted form is `DualGraph.edgeForm len`, with
`edgeForm_symm` and `edgeForm_neg_coord`. *Needs:* 4.3, 4.4, 4.5; StableReduction Layer 4.

**Checks.**

- A single loop of length `n` has pairing `[n]`.
- A tree has zero cycle lattice and zero pairing.
- Two vertices joined by two edges of lengths `a` and `b` have pairing `[a + b]` on the
  rank-one cycle lattice.

### 4.7 The component group as the cokernel of the monodromy map

Let `R` be henselian and `A` semistable. Prove `ComponentCokernel`: the finite cokernel of
`u♯ : X_{A^∨} → Hom(X_A, ℤ)`, with its residue Galois action, is canonically `Φ_A(k̄)` as a
Galois module, hence `Φ_A` as a finite étale `k`-group; for every prime `ℓ` its `ℓ`-primary part
is the cokernel of `u♯ ⊗ ℤ_ℓ`, with the `p`-divisible-group description at the residue prime
(SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, Theorem 11.5, Remark 11.5.2(b) and the opening of 11.6, pp. 455–456). The
integral statement is the target; a rational isomorphism of lattices says nothing about `Φ`.
*Needs:* 2.2, 4.5.

**Checks.**

- For the Tate pairing `[n]` the cokernel is `ℤ/n` (`LatticePairing.componentGroup (rankOne n)`);
  for `n = 0` the cokernel is `ℤ`, infinite, so nondegeneracy is a genuine hypothesis.
- For `n = 1` the cokernel is trivial.
- Two lattices with a rational isomorphism but integral index `n` have component group `ℤ/n`,
  not `0`.

### 4.8 Grothendieck's pairing on component groups

Construct `ComponentPairing`: the canonical pairing `Φ_A × Φ_{A^∨} → ℚ/ℤ` defined by the
obstruction to extending the Poincaré biextension to the Néron models (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX,
§§1.2–1.3, pp. 323–324), and prove that for semistable `A` it is perfect and equals the
discriminant pairing induced by `u` on the two cokernels of 4.7 (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX,
Theorem 11.5, p. 455). Prove `NeronComponentPairing.bilinear`, `galois` (residue Galois
equivariance), `dual` (the pairing of `A^∨` is the transpose), `perfect_semistable`,
`discriminant` (on cokernel classes the value is the fractional value of the inverse of `u`
modulo `ℤ`), `independent_lifts` (changing a representative by an element of the image of `u♯`
changes the rational value by an integer), `zero_left`, `zero_right`, `functorial`
(`⟨f_* a, b⟩_B = ⟨a, (f^∨)_* b⟩_A`) and `good` (good reduction has the zero pairing on zero
groups). Perfectness beyond the semistable case is not asserted. In Lean the lattice-level
pairing is `LatticePairing.discriminantPairing`. *Needs:* 4.5, 4.7.

**Checks.**

- `tate_test` — on `ℤ/n × ℤ/n` the value at residue classes `r, s` is `rs/n` modulo `ℤ`, up to
  the fixed sign convention.
- `lift_test` — replacing `r` by `r + n` changes `rs/n` by the integer `s`.
- `n1_test` (degenerate) — for `n = 1` both groups and the pairing are zero.

### 4.9 The intersection-matrix description of the component group

Let `R` be strictly henselian with algebraically closed residue field, `X` a regular proper flat
curve over `R` with smooth geometrically connected generic fibre, `f_*𝒪_X = 𝒪_R`, special-fibre
components `C_v` with multiplicities `m_v` of greatest common divisor `1`, and intersection matrix
`I`. Prove `IntersectionComponentQuotient`: the component group `Φ_J(k)` of the Jacobian is the
finite group `ker(d : ℤ^V → ℤ) / im(I)` with `d(a) = Σ_v m_v a_v` (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX,
Theorem 12.1(a)–(d), pp. 465–467, with `d = d^t = 1` from the hypotheses), and that for reduced
nodal fibres this is the discriminant group of 4.6. The numerical side is StableReduction
Layer 6's numerical Picard group `TauCeti.NumericalType.Pic` with its degree map
`TauCeti.NumericalType.degree` (the quotient by the rows `a_{ij}/w_j` of the weighted
intersection matrix): the target is the comparison of the kernel of the degree map with `Φ_J(k)`,
through the Picard quotient of 4.4; the multiplicity relation `I·m = 0` and connectedness give
finiteness, which is not a formal consequence of the quotient syntax. Fibres whose multiplicities
have greatest common divisor greater than one are not treated here. *Needs:* 2.2, 4.4;
StableReduction Layer 6; Tau Ceti `NumericalType.Pic`, `NumericalType.degree`.

**Checks.**

- A tree of reduced components gives the trivial group.
- A cycle of `n` reduced components gives `ℤ/n`; two components meeting in two points give
  `ℤ/2`.
- The `I₀*` configuration (five components, central multiplicity `2`) gives `(ℤ/2)²`, matching
  2.9; a computation ignoring the multiplicities would give the wrong group.

### 4.10 The one-node hyperelliptic curve

Let `char K ≠ 2`, `g ≥ 1`, and `f(x, y)` a binary form of degree `2g + 2` over `K` with nonzero
discriminant and leading coefficient `f₀ ≠ 0`; let `C` be the smooth hyperelliptic curve
`z² = f(x, y)` in the weighted projective plane `ℙ(1, 1, g + 1)`, with its two points at infinity
defined over the quadratic étale algebra `D = K[s]/(s² − f₀)`. Define `BgwNodalPinch`, the curve
`C_m : z² = y² f(x, y)` in `ℙ(1, 1, g + 2)`, and prove that `C_m` is a proper geometrically
integral curve of arithmetic genus `g + 1` whose unique singular point `[1 : 0 : 0]` is an
ordinary node with branches conjugate over `D`, that `C → C_m`, `[x : y : w] ↦ [x : y : yw]`, is
the normalisation, an isomorphism away from the node, and that it identifies the two points at
infinity (Bhargava–Gross–Wang, §3, pp. 9–10). The curve is given by its equation; the general
pushout construction that identifies a finite subscheme to a point is NeronModels Part II's
Ferrand pinching, and the genus computation here is by the equation. *Needs:* StableReduction
Layer 1 (nodes and normalisation); AlgebraicCurves Layer 10 (hyperelliptic models).

**Checks.**

- If `f₀` is a square, `D = K × K` and the two branches are rational; the split case is not a
  field extension.
- The arithmetic genus of `C_m` is `g + 1`, one more than that of `C`.
- Away from `[1 : 0 : 0]` the normalisation map is an isomorphism.

### 4.11 The generalised Jacobian of the one-node curve

With `J = Pic⁰(C)` and `J_m = Pic⁰(C_m)`, prove `BgwGeneralizedJacobian`: there is an exact
sequence of fppf group schemes `0 → (Res_{D/K} 𝔾_m)/𝔾_m → J_m → J → 0`, and the torus is
canonically the norm-one torus `R¹_{D/K} 𝔾_m` of ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.0a (`NormTorus.normOne`)
(Bhargava–Gross–Wang, §3, pp. 10–11). The sequence is 4.2 descended to `K` along the quadratic
algebra, and the identification of the quotient torus uses `a/b ↦ a/σ(a)` under the quadratic
involution; the statement is an isomorphism of group schemes, not merely a surjection on
`K`-points. Rational points of `J` and `J_m` need not come from `K`-line bundles (SF.3 T354). *Needs:*
4.2, 4.10; ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.0a (norm-one tori and Weil restriction);
SchemeAndStackFoundations T354.

**Checks.**

- For split `D` the torus is `𝔾_m`; for nonsplit `D` it is the nonsplit one-dimensional torus,
  the quadratic twist of `𝔾_m`.
- On `K`-points the sequence is exact on the left and in the middle, and the cokernel on the
  right is controlled by `H¹(K, R¹_{D/K} 𝔾_m) = K^×/N(D^×)` (Hilbert 90 for the norm-one torus).
- `J_m` has dimension `g + 1` and `J` dimension `g`.

### 4.12 Two-torsion of the one-node curve

Let `L = K[t]/(f(t, 1)/f₀)`, an étale algebra of degree `2g + 2`. Prove `BgwTwoTorsion`:
`J_m[2] ≅ ker(N : Res_{L/K} μ₂ → μ₂)` and `J[2]` is that kernel modulo the diagonal `μ₂`, as
finite étale group schemes over `K`; the geometric orders are `2^{2g+1}` and `2^{2g}`; geometric
points of `J[2]` correspond to even-cardinality subsets of the roots of `f` modulo complement,
and a `K`-rational point of `J[2]` may come from a subset that is Galois-stable as an unordered
pair of complementary subsets without either being `K`-rational (Bhargava–Gross–Wang, §3,
Proposition 22, p. 11; divisor proof p. 12). Galois fixed points do not commute with the
quotient by `μ₂`. *Needs:* 4.11; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6`,
`AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3` (torsion and the Weil pairing).

**Checks.**

- For `g = 1` the geometric orders are `8` and `4`.
- The diagonal `μ₂` is nontrivial and is divided out only for `J[2]`, not for `J_m[2]`.
- A quadratic factorisation `f = f₁ f₂` with `f₁, f₂` conjugate over a quadratic extension gives
  a `K`-rational point of `J[2]` with no `K`-rational odd factor.

### 4.13 Odd-factor torsors

Let `d` be the class of the hyperelliptic line bundle of degree `2`. Prove `BgwOddFactorTorsors`:
`Pic(C)/ℤd = J ⊔ J¹` with `J¹` the degree-one component, a `J`-torsor (SchemeAndStackFoundations
T353, Picard torsors without a rational point), and likewise for `C_m`; the kernel `W[2]` of
multiplication by two on `J¹` is a `J[2]`-torsor, and `W_m[2]` a `J_m[2]`-torsor; `W_m[2](K)`
corresponds to odd-degree factors of `f` over `K`, whereas `W[2](K)` corresponds to odd unordered
factorisations including pairs of factors conjugate over a quadratic extension
(Bhargava–Gross–Wang, §3, Proposition 22(3)–(4), p. 11). A torsor without a `K`-point has no
zero element and is not a group. *Needs:* 4.12; SchemeAndStackFoundations T353, T355(ii).

**Checks.**

- The geometric cardinalities of `W[2]` and `W_m[2]` are those of `J[2]` and `J_m[2]`.
- If `f` has a `K`-rational root then `W_m[2](K)` is nonempty; if `f` is irreducible over `K`
  (of even degree `2g + 2`), `W_m[2](K)` is empty.
- An odd factorisation into two conjugate factors gives a point of `W[2](K)` not in the image
  of `W_m[2](K)`.

### 4.14 The connecting class of the two-torsion sequence

Prove `BgwBoundaryCupProduct`: the exact sequence `0 → μ₂ → J_m[2] → J[2] → 0` has connecting
map `H¹(K, J[2]) → H²(K, μ₂) = Br(K)[2]` equal, under the Weil self-duality of `J[2]`, to the cup
product with the class of the torsor `W[2]`; its kernel is the image of `H¹(K, J_m[2])`
(Bhargava–Gross–Wang, end of §3, p. 12, citing their Proposition 10.3, whose proof is part of
this target). The connecting class is not represented by a rational divisor without the Brauer
obstruction of SF.3 T354. *Needs:* 4.12, 4.13; Mathlib `BrauerGroup`, cup products in Galois
cohomology (ProfiniteCohomology Layer 2); SchemeAndStackFoundations T354.

**Checks.**

- If `W[2]` is a trivial torsor, the connecting map is zero and
  `H¹(K, J_m[2]) → H¹(K, J[2])` is surjective.
- If `C` has a `K`-rational Weierstrass point, `W[2]` is trivial.
- The connecting map lands in `Br(K)[2]` and is killed by base change to `D`.

### 4.15 The Picard scheme of a stable family

Let `S` be an integral Noetherian scheme and `X → S` a stable curve of genus `g > 1`
(StableReduction Layer 3; the moduli of stable curves is SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.4d). Prove
`StableFamilyPicard`: the fibrewise identity component `Pic⁰_{X/S}` is a smooth separated
semi-abelian group scheme over `S` (Yuan, §3.1.3 and Lemma 3.4, pp. 43–44, citing
Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §9.4, Theorem 1). The total space need not be regular, unlike in 4.4,
and the base is not Dedekind: representability is AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry T539, and
the semi-abelian structure of the fibres is 4.1 fibre by fibre. The comparison of the Hodge line
`det e^*Ω¹` with `det π_*ω_{X/S}` belongs to JacobianChallenge Part II, which consumes this
target. *Needs:* 4.1; AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry T539; StableReduction Layer 3.

**Checks.**

- A stable nodal family `xy = π^m` with `m > 1` has singular total space and still satisfies the
  statement; it is not a model to which 4.4 applies.
- Over a point `s` with smooth fibre `Pic⁰_{X_s}` is the Jacobian.
- Over a point with a one-node irreducible fibre the fibre of `Pic⁰_{X/S}` has toric rank `1`.

### Examples

- For a regular model with special fibre two rational curves meeting in two points: toric rank
  `1`, pairing `[2]`, `Φ = ℤ/2` (4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.9).
- For a regular model whose special fibre is a tree of rational curves: cycle lattice `0`,
  `Pic⁰` of the fibre trivial, `Φ = 0`.
- `X₀(11)` over `ℤ_{11}`: the stable model has special fibre two rational curves crossing at the
  two supersingular points `j = 1728` and `j = 0`, with thicknesses `2` and `3`; `H₁(Γ, ℤ) = ℤ`,
  the weighted edge form is `[2 + 3] = [5]`, and the component group of `J₀(11)` at `11` is
  `ℤ/5` (4.6, 4.7).

## Layer 5: Tate modules, conductors and local factors

This layer turns the reduction theory into statements about the Galois representation on the
Tate module: the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion, isogeny invariance of good reduction, the
`p`-adic comparison for the residue prime, the conductor of an abelian variety, and the local
Euler polynomial with its full monodromy. Throughout `K` is the fraction field of a henselian
discrete valuation ring `R` with residue field `k`, `A` an abelian variety over `K` and `ℓ` a
prime; the statements that need a finite residue field, a complete `R` or `ℓ ≠ char k` say so.

### 5.1 Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich

Let `R` be henselian and `ℓ ≠ char k`. Prove `NeronOggShafarevich`: `A` has good reduction over
`R` (an abelian-scheme model, 1.9) if and only if the inertia group acts trivially on `T_ℓ(A)`
(Conrad, §4, discussion before Lemma 4.3, pp. 9–10; Theorem 5.8, pp. 20–22; SGA 7 I, Exposé IX,
Theorem 10.4, p. 444). Good reduction makes the prime-to-`char k` torsion finite étale over `R`,
hence unramified. Conversely an unramified action is unipotent, so `A` is semistable by 3.8; the
monodromy pairing of 4.5 is then zero, its nondegeneracy forces `t = 0`, and `A` has good
reduction by `toric_zero` of 3.1. The identification of the inertia operator of 3.7 with the
monodromy pairing of 4.5 is part of this target. The statement concerns the whole `ℓ`-adic
representation; triviality on one torsion level `A[N]` is a different hypothesis (3.10). For a
non-henselian discrete valuation ring the good-reduction predicate descends from the
henselisation, and this descent is stated explicitly in 5.2. *Needs:* 1.9, 3.8, 4.5;
`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6`.

**Checks.**

- A split Tate curve has nontrivial inertia action on `T_ℓ` for every `ℓ` and bad reduction.
- For an elliptic curve with additive reduction the inertia action on `T_ℓ` is not unipotent, so
  neither direction of the criterion is vacuous.
- (non-example) Unramified `A[N]` for one `N` does not imply good reduction: a Tate curve with
  `N ∣ ord(q)` has unramified `N`-torsion.

### 5.2 Good reduction is isogeny invariant

Prove `GoodIsogeny`: isogenous abelian varieties over `K` have good reduction over the same
discrete valuation rings (Conrad, Proposition 4.1, pp. 8–9, and pp. 9–10). An isogeny induces an
isomorphism of the rational Tate modules `V_ℓ(A) ≅ V_ℓ(B)` even when `ℓ` divides its degree,
inertia acts trivially on the torsion-free lattice `T_ℓ(A)` if and only if it does on `V_ℓ(A)`,
and 5.1 applies; for a non-henselian `R` the abelian-scheme model descends from the henselisation
(fpqc descent of the proper smooth model and of its group law), which is part of this target.
*Needs:* 5.1; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6` (isogeny compatibility of Tate modules).

**Checks.**

- The Néron models of `A` and `B` are both abelian schemes, but the integral Tate lattices
  `T_ℓ(A)` and `T_ℓ(B)` are not identified when `ℓ` divides the degree.
- A `p`-power isogeny over a `p`-adic field is not an étale isomorphism of the integral models;
  the statement is about good reduction, not about isomorphism of models.
- Multiplication by `n` is an isogeny from `A` to itself, and the statement is trivially
  consistent.

### 5.3 Period rings and the `p`-adic comparison at the residue prime

Let `K` be a finite extension of `ℚ_p`. Define Fontaine's period rings `B_cris ⊂ B_st ⊂ B_dR`
over `K` (Fontaine, *Le corps des périodes p-adiques*, Astérisque 223 (1994), §§1–3; Mathlib has
`B_dR^+` and `B_dR` in `RingTheory/Perfectoid`, and the crystalline and semistable rings with
their Frobenius `φ` and monodromy `N` are built here), the functors `D_cris`, `D_st`, `D_dR` on
continuous `ℚ_p`-representations of `Gal(K̄/K)`, and the predicates crystalline, semistable and
de Rham (dimension of the functor value equal to the dimension of the representation). Then
prove `PadicComparison`: if `A` has good reduction then `V_p(A)` is crystalline, and if `A` has
semistable reduction then `V_p(A)` is semistable, with `D_st(V_p(A))` the Dieudonné module of
the Raynaud extension of 3.11 and `N` the monodromy operator induced by the lattice `Y` of 3.12
(Fontaine, *Sur certains types de représentations p-adiques…*, Ann. of Math. 115 (1982), §6, for
the crystalline case via `p`-divisible groups; Coleman–Iovita, *The Frobenius and monodromy
operators for curves and abelian varieties*, Duke Math. J. 97 (1999), main theorem of the
introduction, for the semistable case; the statement and its use are in
Boxer–Calegari–Gee–Pilloni 2021, proof of Proposition 2.8.1, pp. 194–195). The convention for
the dual: `V_p(A)` is the homological Tate module and `H¹_ét(A_{K̄}, ℚ_p)` its dual, so
`D_cris(H¹)` is the dual Dieudonné module with the opposite Hodge weights. *Needs:* 1.9, 3.1,
3.11, 3.12; Mathlib `BDeRham`, `WittVector.fontaineTheta`.

**Checks.**

- `V_p(A)` is de Rham for every `A`, and a de Rham representation is not automatically
  crystalline: an elliptic curve with additive reduction at `p` gives a representation that is de
  Rham but not semistable.
- For a Tate curve `V_p(E_q)` is semistable and not crystalline, with `N ≠ 0`.
- At the residue prime the inertia invariants of `V_p(A)` are not the finite part of 3.5; the
  crystalline predicate, not unramifiedness, detects good reduction.

### 5.4 The conductor interface

Let `K` be a nonarchimedean local field with finite residue field and `ℓ ≠ char k`. The conductor
exponent `f(A)` of `A` is the Artin conductor, with its Swan part, of the Weil–Deligne
representation attached to `H¹_ét(A_{K̄}, ℚ_ℓ)` (the dual of `V_ℓ(A)`); the conductors and the
Weil–Deligne representation are `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.3` and `R01.6` and are not
redefined here (Calegari–Geraghty, Appendix, Lemma A.7 and its proof, p. 89). Prove
`ConductorInterface.independent_of_ell` for `dim A > 1` (the exponent is independent of `ℓ`:
after a finite extension `A` is semistable by 3.9 and the exponent is computed from the Raynaud
extension of 3.11, whose toric and abelian ranks do not depend on `ℓ`), `dual` (`A` and `A^∨`
have the same conductor) and `isogeny` (isogenous varieties have the same conductor, by 5.2 and
the isomorphism of rational Tate modules). *Needs:* 3.9, 3.11, 5.2;
`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.3`, `R01.6`.

**Checks.**

- Good reduction gives `f(A) = 0`.
- Multiplicative elliptic reduction gives `f(E) = 1`, split or not.
- Wild additive reduction at `p = 2` or `3` has a positive Swan term, so `f(E) > 2` occurs; an
  interface forcing `f ≤ 2` for additive reduction would be wrong.

### 5.5 Conductors of semistable abelian varieties

Under the hypotheses of 5.4 with `A` semistable, prove `SemistableConductorRank`: the Swan
conductor vanishes and the conductor exponent is the toric rank,
`f(A) = 2g − dim V_ℓ(A)^I = 2g − (t + 2a) = t` (Conrad, Lemma 5.4, pp. 17–18, for the dimension of
the invariants; Calegari–Geraghty, Lemma A.7, p. 89, for the use with surfaces). The tame
unipotent operator of 3.7 factors through the prime-to-`p` quotient of inertia, so wild inertia
acts trivially. *Needs:* 3.5, 3.7, 5.4.

**Checks.**

- Good reduction has `t = 0` and conductor `0`.
- A multiplicative elliptic curve has `t = 1` and conductor `1`.
- An abelian surface with `t = 2` has conductor `2` and an abelian surface with `t = 1`, `a = 1`
  has conductor `1`.

### 5.6 The local Euler polynomial at bad places

Let `K` be a nonarchimedean local field with complete `R`, residue field of cardinality `q`, and
`ℓ ≠ char k`. The local Euler polynomial `P_v(A, T) = det(1 − T·Frob_q | H¹_ét(A_{K̄}, ℚ_ℓ)^{I})`,
with `H¹` the dual of the homological Tate module and `Frob_q` geometric Frobenius, is defined in
`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6` (local Euler factor of an abelian variety) on top of the
Weil–Deligne factor of `R01.2`, and its agreement with Mathlib's
`WeierstrassCurve.localPolynomial` for elliptic curves is proved there. Prove
`LocalEulerPolynomial`: for semistable `A`, the inertia invariants of `H¹` are the dual of
`T_ℓ(A)/T_t` (3.5, 3.6), geometric Frobenius acts on the toric character contribution with
eigenvalues of weight `0` and on the abelian contribution with eigenvalues of weight `1` (through
the Raynaud extension of 3.11), hence `P_v(A, T)` has integer coefficients independent of `ℓ`;
for arbitrary `A` the same follows after the finite extension of 3.9 by descent; and the
inertia semisimplification alone does not determine `P_v` (Raynaud 1994, Proposition 4.6.1,
p. 315, and Proposition 4.7.4, p. 317, which act on the homological realisation with arithmetic
Frobenius; the passage to the cohomological dual with geometric Frobenius is part of this
target). *Needs:* 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.11; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`, `R01.6`.

**Checks.**

- A split Tate curve has `P_v = 1 − T`; with arithmetic Frobenius on the homological invariants
  one would get `1 − qT`, which is not this convention.
- A nonsplit Tate curve has `P_v = 1 + T`, and additive reduction has `P_v = 1`.
- For a semistable abelian surface with `t = 1`, `a = 1`, `P_v` has degree `3` with one root of
  absolute value `1` and two of absolute value `q^{-1/2}`.

### 5.7 Residual conductors and dual component groups

Let `K` be local with residue characteristic `r`, `A` semistable, and `ℓ ≠ r` a prime not
dividing the order of `Φ_{A^∨}(k̄)`. Prove `ResidualConductorComponents`: the inertia invariants
of the residual representation `A[ℓ]` have the same dimension as those of `V_ℓ(A)`, so the
residual and characteristic-zero conductor exponents agree (Calegari–Geraghty, Appendix,
Lemma A.7 and proof, p. 89). The defect of reduction of the saturated invariant submodule is
measured by the `ℓ`-primary part of the cokernel of the monodromy map (4.7), which vanishes
under the hypothesis; by the perfect pairing of 4.8 one may use `#Φ_A(k̄)` in place of
`#Φ_{A^∨}(k̄)`, but that is a consequence of 4.8 and not an assumption. *Needs:* 3.5, 4.7, 4.8,
5.4; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.3` (conductors of residual representations).

**Checks.**

- For a Tate curve with `ℓ ∣ ord(q)` the residual inertia action is trivial and the residual
  conductor is `0`, while the characteristic-zero exponent is `1`; the hypothesis
  `ℓ ∤ #Φ` is necessary.
- For a Tate curve with `ℓ ∤ ord(q)` both exponents are `1`.
- For good reduction both exponents are `0` for every `ℓ ≠ r`.

### Examples

- For `E = X_0(11)` over `ℚ_{11}` (split multiplicative, `ord(q) = 5`): inertia is unipotent on
  `T_ℓ` for `ℓ ≠ 11`, the conductor exponent is `1`, `P_v = 1 − T`, and for `ℓ = 5` the residual
  conductor drops to `0`.
- For an elliptic curve with good reduction at `p` and `#E(𝔽_p) = p + 1 − a`, the local
  polynomial is `1 − aT + pT²`, and the comparison with Mathlib's `localPolynomial` is
  `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6`.

### Dependencies

Layers 1, 3 and 4; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`, `R01.3`, `R01.6`;
`AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3`; EllipticCurves Layer 4; Mathlib `BDeRham` for 5.3.

## Layer 6: interfaces for modularity and finiteness

The last layer packages what the consumers use: the functoriality of character lattices and
component groups under given homomorphisms of modular Jacobians, the integral differential
lattice under semistable base change and under isogeny, the comparison of every elliptic
equation-level invariant with its scheme-level counterpart, the compatible system of
cohomology of an abelian variety, the semistable-ordinary adapters for abelian surfaces over
`ℚ₂`, and the full-level extension for curves. The base hypotheses are those of the layer each
statement draws on; number-field bases are Dedekind schemes as in Layer 1.

### 6.1 Degeneracy maps and monodromy adjoints

Let `R` be henselian and let homomorphisms between semistable abelian varieties (the degeneracy
maps between modular Jacobians supplied by ModularCurvesPartII, which consumes this roadmap, are
the intended instances) be given. Prove `DegeneracyFunctoriality`: each homomorphism `f : A → B`
extends to the Néron models (1.5) and induces the contravariant character map
`f_T^* : X_B → X_A` (2.4), the covariant component map `f_* : Φ_A → Φ_B` (2.2), the dual maps for
`f^∨`, and the commutative diagrams `u_A(y, f^* x) = u_B((f^∨)^* y, x)` and
`⟨f_* a, b⟩_B = ⟨a, (f^∨)_* b⟩_A` of 4.5 and 4.8 (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, 10.2.6–10.2.8, p. 441;
§1.2, p. 323). No level-lowering statement and no exactness of Néron models is asserted.
*Needs:* 1.5, 2.2, 2.4, 4.5, 4.8.

**Checks.**

- The source and target of the character map are reversed relative to `f`.
- For `f = [m]` the character map is multiplication by `m` and the component map is
  multiplication by `m`.
- For an isogeny of Tate curves with parameters `q` and `q^m` the adjunction identity reads
  `n·(m y)·x = (mn)·y·x` on the rank-one lattices.

### 6.2 Character exact sequences with verified kernels

Given an exact sequence of tori `0 → T₁ → T → T₂ → 0` over `k`, prove `CharacterExactSequences`:
the character lattices form an exact sequence `0 → X^*(T₂) → X^*(T) → X^*(T₁) → 0` (the exactness
of the character functor is ReductiveGroups Layer 4), and, given compatible integral monodromy
maps for the three tori, the snake lemma on the lattices gives the induced sequence of component
groups with its kernel and cokernel terms (SGA 7 I, Exposé IX, 10.2.6–10.2.8, p. 441;
Theorem 11.5, p. 455). Applied to degeneracy maps between modular Jacobians, the exactness of the
torus sequence and the saturation of the lattices are hypotheses that the consumer establishes;
they are not consequences of an exact sequence of abelian varieties (Yuan–Zhang, Erratum,
introduction, p. 1). *Needs:* 4.7, 6.1; ReductiveGroups Layer 4.

**Checks.**

- For `T = T₁ × T₂` the lattice sequence splits.
- For `T₁ = μ_n`-type non-torus kernels the hypothesis fails and nothing is asserted: the
  sequence must consist of tori.
- The finite cokernels of the three monodromy maps are not erased: the snake lemma relates
  three component groups and two further finite terms.

### 6.3 Semistable base change of the differential lattice

Let `K` be a number field, `S` the spectrum of its ring of integers (or a localisation), `A`
semistable at every finite place of `S`, and `K'/K` a finite extension with Dedekind base `S'`.
Prove `SemistableDifferentialBasechange`: the pullback to `S'` of the lattice `ω_A` of 1.11
identifies with the lattice of the identity Néron model of `A ×_K K'` at every finite place,
including ramified ones (Yuan–Zhang, §1.1, p. 534). The proof is 3.3 place by place, the
localisation statement of 1.11, and gluing over the Dedekind base; the component groups change
and the full models do not pull back. *Needs:* 1.11, 3.3.

**Checks.**

- For a Tate curve the differential `du/u` on the identity torus is unchanged by ramified base
  change while the component group grows; no identification with `dq/q` is claimed.
- For good reduction everywhere the statement is 1.10 applied to abelian schemes.
- Without semistability the identity model can change (additive reduction becoming good), and
  the statement fails.

### 6.4 Isogenies and the differential lattice

Let `K` be a number field, `A, B` abelian varieties of the same dimension with global Néron
models, and `f : A → B` an isogeny. Prove `IsogenyDifferentialExport`: `f` extends to a
homomorphism of Néron models and induces an inclusion `f^* : ω_B → ω_A` of finite projective
lattices of the same rank with torsion cokernel, invertible after tensoring with `K`; the length
of the cokernel at each finite place is the local datum the height theory consumes, and no
degree-only formula and no vanishing of the `p`-primary contributions is asserted (Yuan–Zhang,
Erratum, introduction, p. 1, and Theorems 1–2, p. 2). *Needs:* 1.5, 1.11, 5.2.

**Checks.**

- At a place `v | p` dividing the degree of `f`, `f^*` can fail to be an isomorphism even when
  both varieties have good reduction there: an isogeny of degree `p` whose reduction at `v` is
  the Frobenius of an ordinary elliptic curve has `f^* ω ≡ 0` modulo `p`.
- At a place prime to the degree with good reduction, `f^*` is an isomorphism.
- The ranks of `ω_A` and `ω_B` are equal, so the cokernel is torsion.

### 6.5 Equation-level and scheme-level good reduction

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring and `W` a minimal integral Weierstrass model of an elliptic
curve `E` over `K`. Prove `EquationGoodComparison`: Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.HasGoodReduction R W`
(the multiplicative valuation of the discriminant is `1`, that is, `ord(Δ) = 0`; equivalently
`hasGoodReduction_iff_isElliptic_reduction`) holds if and only if the smooth proper Weierstrass
scheme of `W` over `R` (ModularCurves Layer 1 and `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A1`) is an
abelian scheme, if and only if `E` has good reduction in the sense of 1.9; the scheme-level
property is independent of the chosen minimal model (Bosch–Lütkebohmert–Raynaud, §1.5,
pp. 20–23). Where the geometric input is stated over a strictly henselian base (2.7), base change
there and descend. *Needs:* 1.9, 2.7; Mathlib `WeierstrassCurve.HasGoodReduction`,
`hasGoodReduction_iff_isElliptic_reduction`; EllipticCurves Layer 4; ModularCurves Layer 1.

**Checks.**

- The multiplicative valuation `1` means `ord(Δ) = 0`; a reading `ord(Δ) = 1` would be `I₁`,
  which is bad reduction.
- A non-minimal Weierstrass equation with `ord(Δ) = 12` of a curve with good reduction is not a
  counterexample: the predicate is on the minimal model.
- The comparison holds over an arbitrary discrete valuation ring, not only a strictly henselian
  one.

### 6.6 Equation-level and toric multiplicative reduction

Prove `EquationMultiplicativeComparison`: Mathlib's `HasMultiplicativeReduction R W`
(`ord(Δ) > 0`, `ord(c₄) = 0`) holds if and only if the reduced cubic is nodal and the identity
fibre `M_k⁰` is a one-dimensional torus; the residual quadratic of Mathlib's
`HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction` (Tau Ceti's `nodePolynomial`) splits if and only if that torus
is split, so equation-level splitness is torus splitness (Tate, §4, p. 41). *Needs:* 2.6, 2.8;
Mathlib `HasMultiplicativeReduction`, `HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction`; Tau Ceti
`nodePolynomial`; EllipticCurves Layer 4.

**Checks.**

- Good and multiplicative reduction are exclusive on both sides.
- Splitness is a statement over `k`, not over `k̄`: every multiplicative curve is split over
  `k̄`, and the comparison must keep the residue field.
- Tau Ceti's `exists_quadraticTwist_hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction` produces a split twist,
  whose torus is `𝔾_m`.

### 6.7 The minimal discriminant and the regular fibre

Prove `EquationDiscriminantComparison`: EllipticCurves' `localMinimalDiscriminant` valuation
`v(Δ_min)` (Tau Ceti `localMinimalDiscriminantValuation`) is invariant under changes of minimal
equation, equals `n` for type `Iₙ`, and for the additive types equals the tame table values of
2.10 when `char k ≠ 2, 3`, the wild values being those of the full Tate algorithm (Tate, §6,
discriminant row and the restriction, p. 46). The relation with the conductor,
`v(Δ_min) = f(E) + m − 1` (Ogg's formula), is `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.3`, which
consumes 2.8 and 2.10 and is not restated. *Needs:* 2.8, 2.10; EllipticCurves Layer 4; Tau Ceti
`localMinimalDiscriminantValuation`.

**Checks.**

- `I₀`, `I₁`, `II` have the same component count and discriminant valuations `0`, `1`, `2` in the
  tame case.
- `I₅` has `v(Δ_min) = 5`.
- For `char k = 2` the valuation of a type-`II*` curve can exceed `10`.

### 6.8 The Tamagawa number counts rational components

Let `R` be complete with finite residue field `k`. Prove `EquationComponentComparison`:
EllipticCurves Layer 4's local index `c_p = [E(K) : E₀(K)]` equals `#Φ_E(k)`, through 2.6; the
geometric component count `m` and `#Φ_E(k̄)` are different invariants (Tate, §§4–6, pp. 41–46).
*Needs:* 2.2, 2.6, 2.9; EllipticCurves Layer 4.

**Checks.**

- Nonsplit `Iₙ` has `c_p = 1` for odd `n` and `2` for even `n`, while `#Φ(k̄) = n` and `m = n`
  (`ComponentGroup.card_fixedPoints_neg`).
- `I₀*` has `m = 5` and `#Φ(k̄) = 4`; `c_p ∈ {1, 2, 4}` according to the Galois action.
- Split `Iₙ` has `c_p = n`.

### 6.9 The minimal differential generates the Néron lattice

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring and `W` a minimal integral Weierstrass equation. Prove
`EquationMinimalDifferential`: the invariant differential `dx/(2y + a₁x + a₃)` of EllipticCurves
Layer 1, with its alternative expression on the chart where that denominator vanishes, is a
basis of the local lattice `ω_E` of 1.11; under a change between minimal equations it is
multiplied by the unit `u` of the change of variables (Tate, Theorem 4.2 and the differential
computation, pp. 42–43). The comparison identifies the smooth-locus charts of the Weierstrass
scheme with charts of the Néron model (2.7) and the pullback of `Ω¹` along the identity section
(SchemeAndStackFoundations T361); it is not `dq/q` of a Tate parameter. *Needs:* 1.11, 2.7;
EllipticCurves Layer 1; SchemeAndStackFoundations T361.

**Checks.**

- In residue characteristic `2` or `3` the chart with denominator `3x² + 2a₂x + a₄ − a₁y` is
  used where `2y + a₁x + a₃` vanishes; no division by a vanishing denominator occurs.
- A non-minimal equation with `u ∈ 𝔪` gives a differential that is `π`-times a generator, not a
  generator.
- For good reduction the basis element is the Néron differential of the abelian scheme.

### 6.10 The compatible system of an abelian variety

Let `F` be a number field and `A` an abelian variety over `F`. Prove
`StrictCompatibleSystemExport`: for `0 ≤ i ≤ 2 dim A`, the representations
`H^i_ét(A_F̄, ℚ_ℓ) = Λ^i H¹` form a strictly compatible system of `ℚ`-rational Weil–Deligne
representations, pure of weight `i`, with the Weil–Deligne conventions of
`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`; `H¹` is the dual of the homological Tate module, and
for an abelian surface the `GSp₄` multiplier of `H¹` is `ε_ℓ^{-1}`
(Boxer–Calegari–Gee–Pilloni 2021, Proposition 2.8.1, Definition 2.8.2 and Remark 2.8.3,
pp. 194–195; the printed `dim X` is `dim A`). The inputs are 3.9 and 3.12 for the local
description at places of bad reduction through the strict `1`-motive, 5.3 at places above `ℓ`,
and the `ℓ`-independence of 5.6; the compatibility across `ℓ` at the coefficient prime (Noot,
Saito's base-change argument) is part of this target. *Needs:* 3.9, 3.12, 5.3, 5.6;
`ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.2`.

**Checks.**

- For `i = 0` the system has rank one and weight zero; `H^i = 0` for `i > 2 dim A`.
- For an elliptic curve the system at `i = 1` is the dual of the Tate-module system, with
  determinant `ε_ℓ^{-1}`.
- At a place of good reduction the Weil–Deligne representation is unramified with `N = 0`.

### 6.11 Semistable ordinary reduction

For `A` over `ℚ_p`, define `SemistableOrdinaryAdapter`: `A` has semistable ordinary reduction if
it is semistable (3.1) and the abelian quotient `B` of `M_k⁰` is an ordinary abelian variety over
`𝔽_p` (Boxer–Calegari–Gee–Pilloni 2025, Definition 9.1.7, p. 190). The toric rank is unrestricted;
a purely toric fibre has `B = 0` and is ordinary. Prove that the `p`-primary finite and toric
parts of 3.5 (through `p`-divisible groups, not inertia invariants) give the connected–étale
decomposition of the `p`-divisible group of `B`. *Needs:* 2.3, 3.1, 3.5, 3.6;
`AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3` (ordinary `p`-divisible groups of abelian varieties).

**Checks.**

- Good ordinary reduction is semistable ordinary.
- A split Tate curve over `ℚ_p` is semistable ordinary with `B = 0`.
- An abelian surface with good supersingular reduction is not semistable ordinary; ordinarity of
  `B` alone without semistability is not the definition.

### 6.12 The isotropic filtration of an ordinary surface

Let `B` be a principally polarised abelian surface over `ℚ₂` with semistable ordinary reduction.
Prove `OrdinaryIsotropicFiltration`: `T₂(B)` contains a saturated `Gal(ℚ̄₂/ℚ₂)`-stable isotropic
submodule of rank two whose reduction is a Galois-stable Lagrangian subspace of `B[2]`: for toric
rank `t = 2` it is the toric part `T_t` of 3.5 (of rank `2`; the whole `T₂(B)` has rank `4` and
is not isotropic), for `t = 1` the lift of the rank-one connected part of `T_f/T_t`, and for
`t = 0` the connected part of the ordinary `2`-divisible group (Boxer–Calegari–Gee–Pilloni 2025,
proof of Lemma 9.1.8, p. 191, where the toric subscript is missing). *Needs:* 3.5, 3.6, 6.11.

**Checks.**

- For `t = 2` the submodule has rank `2` and `T₂(B)` rank `4`.
- The submodule is saturated, so its reduction has dimension `2` in `B[2]`.
- The reduction is isotropic for the Weil pairing on `B[2]`.

### 6.13 Residual image in `S₅(b)` and a rational two-torsion point

Under the hypotheses of 6.12 and the identification `S₆ ≅ GSp₄(𝔽₂)` fixed by the source, prove
`OrdinaryResidualPointExport`: if the image of the residual representation on `B[2]` lies in the
subgroup `S₅(b)` (one of the two conjugacy classes of `S₅` in `S₆`), then that image is a
`2`-group and `B[2](ℚ₂) ≠ 0` (Boxer–Calegari–Gee–Pilloni 2025, Lemma 9.1.8, p. 191). By 6.12 the
image lies in a Siegel parabolic, whose intersection with `S₅(b)` has order `48` and is a
`2`-group; a `2`-group acting on a nonzero `𝔽₂`-vector space fixes a nonzero vector
(`Interfaces.exists_ne_zero_fixed_of_two_group`). The choice of `S₅(b)` and the order of the
intersection are finite-group inputs supplied with the statement. *Needs:* 6.12; Mathlib finite
group theory.

**Checks.**

- A `2`-group acting linearly on `𝔽₂⁴` fixes a nonzero vector; a group of order `3` permuting
  the three nonzero vectors of `𝔽₂²` fixes none (negative control for the `2`-group hypothesis).
- A rational Weierstrass point of the curve alone, without the ordinary hypothesis, does not give
  the conclusion.
- The other `S₅` conjugacy class is not asserted to give a `2`-group.

### 6.14 Full-level extension for curves

Let `K` be a function field of one variable over a field `k`, `C` a smooth projective
geometrically integral curve of genus `g > 1` over `K`, `J = Jac(C)`, `N ≥ 3` prime to `char K`
(`N = 3` if `char K ≠ 3`, else `N = 4`), and `K' = K(J[N])`. Prove `YuanFullLevelExtension`:
`J ×_K K'` is semistable at every valuation of `K'` trivial on `k` (3.10 at the valuations prime
to `N`); `C ×_K K'` is semistable at those valuations by the curve–Jacobian criterion of
StableReduction Layer 7, with that criterion's residue-field hypotheses as explicit hypotheses
here; and `[K' : K] < N^{4g²}` because `Gal(K'/K)` injects into `GSp_{2g}(ℤ/N)`
(`Interfaces.card_lt_of_subgroup_matrix`) (Yuan, Lemma 4.9 and the full-level paragraph, p. 75,
where `J` is the Jacobian of `C`). No height lower bound is asserted. *Needs:* 3.10;
StableReduction Layer 7; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations:R01.6`,
`AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli:A3` (the Galois action on `J[N]` preserves the Weil pairing).

**Checks.**

- `N = 3` when `char K ≠ 3` and `N = 4` when `char K = 3`.
- The Galois group of `K'/K` is a subgroup of `GSp_{2g}(ℤ/N)`, so its order is less than
  `N^{4g²}`.
- A curve already semistable at a valuation stays semistable after the extension.

### Examples

The acceptance suite of this roadmap combines the layers on four examples, each under its own
hypotheses: an elliptic curve with good reduction over a complete ring with finite residue field
(abelian scheme, `Φ = 0`, `c_p = 1`, `P_v = 1 − aT + qT²`); split multiplicative `Iₙ` (identity
fibre `𝔾_m`, `Φ(k̄) = ℤ/n`, pairing `[n]`, `c_p = n`, `P_v = 1 − T`, components `ℤ/en` after
ramified base change); nonsplit multiplicative `Iₙ` over a finite residue field (nonsplit torus,
Frobenius `−1` on `Φ(k̄)`, `c_p ∈ {1, 2}`, `P_v = 1 + T`); and a regular semistable curve over a
strictly henselian base with algebraically closed residue field whose special fibre has two
components meeting twice (toric rank `1`, cycle pairing `[2]`, `Φ = ℤ/2`), against a rational
tree (`H₁ = 0`, `Pic⁰ = 0`, `Φ = 0`). The unramified-`3`-torsion example of 3.10 (a split Tate
curve over `ℚ₂` with `q = 8` has unramified `E[3]` and multiplicative reduction: semistable, not
good) is the `N = 3`, `k = 𝔽₂` instance used by the abelian-surface modularity consumer.
