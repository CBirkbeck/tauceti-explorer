# Roadmap: Deligne weights, purity and the Weil bounds

Build the arithmetic of Frobenius eigenvalues, then weights of sheaves and
complexes, cohomological purity, geometric semisimplicity and absolute hard
Lefschetz. The resulting API serves point counting, exponential sums, arithmetic
representations, rigid coefficients and finite-field equidistribution.

There are two purity arguments. The Rosati estimate, symplectic tensor powers,
rational pencil factors and Cartesian powers give smooth projective purity.
Local monodromy and square improvement give sharp curve-coefficient purity,
which supplies the general direct-image theorem.

Suggested homes are `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Weights/`,
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Weights/` and
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/Lefschetz/`. API names are relative to
`TauCeti.Weights`, except in DWP.9, where they are relative to
`TauCeti.HardLefschetz`. [Suggested.lean](Suggested.lean) gives representative
forms; the mathematics in this README is definitive.

## Scope and neighbouring roadmaps

This roadmap owns numerical, punctual and determinantal weights, local bounds,
weight–monodromy on finite-field curves, the purity theorems, mixed-complex
estimates, weight filtrations, geometric semisimplicity, absolute Lefschetz and
the weight-facing arithmetic and distribution exports of DWP.10.

Import schemes, finite cohomology, trace formulae and base change from
`SchemeAndStackFoundations`; coefficient categories, Tate twists, six operations,
duality, cycle classes and weak Lefschetz from `EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheaves`;
arithmetic-model approximation from `AdicCoefficientsAndComparisons`; and
pencils, vanishing cycles, monodromy filtrations and invariant cycles from
`LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles`. Polarizations, Rosati positivity and
endomorphism polynomials come from `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli`, with
Tate/Galois realization from `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations`.

`WeilConjectures` owns zeta assembly, integral degree factors and functional
equations. `WeightsInEtaleCohomology` supplies representation-facing adapters;
`FiniteFieldsAndCharacterSums` consumes upper bounds;
`PadicDifferentialEquationsAndRigidCohomology:RD.6` supplies the rigid-coefficient
fibres for the numerical predicates. Relative hard Lefschetz, perverse sheaves
and decomposition belong to `EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheaves:EDC.7`.

Import the existing Hasse theorem, Abel–Jacobi construction, symplectic invariant
theory, reductive groups and compact representation theory. The contracts below
also specify the required base-point-free Jacobian descent, universal elliptic
full monodromy and analytic comparison interfaces in those owners' Part II.

## Conventions and order

- Use geometric Frobenius, with scalar q⁻¹ and weight −2 on ℚ_ℓ(1). At a
  closed point of degree e use q_x=q^e. Finite base extension replaces
  (q,F) by (q^r,F^r), preserving weight.
- Integer Weil weights require algebraicity and the common modulus at every
  complex conjugate; integrality is separate. Fixed-ι real weights are
  2 log_q|ια| for α≠0. The chosen coefficient embedding is neither canonical
  nor ℓ-adically continuous.
- Characteristic roots are multisets, with multiplicities from generalized
  eigenspaces. Purity allows Jordan blocks. Transpose preserves roots;
  contragredient means inverse transpose.
- Arbitrary scalar twists give Weil lines; étale descent retains the unit and
  continuity conditions. Half twists require a square-root choice. Tate twist r
  subtracts 2r from weight.
- Hⁱ(K[m])=Hⁱ⁺ᵐ(K). On a smooth base, a lisse sheaf of punctual weight β
  gives complex weight β+m−2r after [m](r). Upper bounds use cohomology
  stalks; lower bounds use Verdier duality, retaining dimension/Tate shifts.
- Keep normality, lissity, geometric connectedness and arithmetic witnesses
  wherever stated. Geometric semisimplicity does not give arithmetic
  semisimplicity. Potential purity includes an explicit model.
- Stalk Newton polygons sort slopes v(α)/v(q) with multiplicity. Newton couples
  normalize v(q)=1 and record (v(α),v(q^n/α)) for weight n. Keep branch
  orientation lines and alternating-pairing signs.

DWP.5's coefficient prefix precedes DWP.2; its local and analytic suffix uses
the earlier estimates. DWP.6 supplies the curve case of DWP.7, which supplies
DWP.8. DWP.9 imports
`LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles:LPV.7:invariant-cycles`. Equidistribution
uses DWP.7 and DWP.8. These dependencies apply to individual targets rather
than forcing a cycle between whole layers.

Each numbered item is a mathematical target with its hypotheses. Definitions
include API and discriminating tests. Inputs B1–B41 are pinned library
declarations; E1–E69 are imported declarations or layers. Their exact names
and supplier contracts follow the layers.

## DWP.0 — Eigenvalue weights and functorial linear algebra

Start with the minimal polynomial and characteristic-root multiset. Scalar extension, exact sequences and polynomial kernels give the common numerical language for every coefficient realization. The prescribed-base extension in the complex-isomorphism construction is a mathematical target in its own right; a bare ring equivalence does not establish it.

### 0.1. Weil q-numbers of integer weight

Fix a real number q > 1 and n ∈ ℤ. An element α of a field K of characteristic 0 is a Weil q-number of weight n (Deligne: pure of weight n relative to q) if α is algebraic over ℚ and every complex root of its minimal polynomial over ℚ has absolute value q^{n/2}. The predicate depends only on the minimal polynomial of α. So it is preserved and reflected by every field homomorphism K → K′, and it does not depend on the ambient field or on a chosen splitting field. Equivalently, |σ(α)| = q^{n/2} for every field homomorphism σ : ℚ(α) → ℂ. When K is algebraic over ℚ, it is equivalent to |φ(α)| = q^{n/2} for every field homomorphism φ : K → ℂ. A Weil q-number is nonzero, and its weight is unique. Integrality over ℤ is a separate predicate.

Scope: Use q>1 and integer weights. The comparison with all maps K→ℂ assumes K algebraic over ℚ; for ℚ̄_ℓ use 0.6. Algebraicity prevents the zero minimal polynomial of a transcendental element from making the root condition vacuous.

API:

- `IsWeilNumber`: Algebraicity over ℚ and modulus q^(n/2) at every complex root of the minimal polynomial.

- `IsWeilNumber.isAlgebraic`: A Weil q-number is algebraic over ℚ.

- `IsWeilNumber.norm_eq`: Every field embedding into ℂ sends the Weil number to a number of modulus q^(n/2).

- `isWeilNumber_iff_forall_embedding`: If the ambient field is algebraic over ℚ, purity is equivalent to the common modulus at every complex embedding.

- `isWeilNumber_map_iff`: Field homomorphisms preserve and reflect the minimal-polynomial purity predicate.

- `IsWeilNumber.of_aeval_eq_zero`: If P ∈ ℚ[T] is nonzero, P(α) = 0 and every complex root of P has absolute value q^{n/2}, then α is a Weil q-number of weight n.

- `IsWeilNumber.ne_zero`: A Weil q-number is nonzero.

- `IsWeilNumber.weight_unique`: For q>1 a nonzero Weil number has a unique integer weight.

Tests:

- `isWeilNumber_roots_T2_sub_T_add_two`: The roots of T² − T + 2 are Weil 2-numbers of weight 1: the discriminant is −7, so the roots (1 ± i√7)/2 are complex conjugate with product 2.

- `not_isWeilNumber_one_add_sqrt_two`: 1 + √2 is a Weil q-number for no q > 1 and no n. Its conjugates 1 ± √2 have absolute values with product 1, forcing n = 0, while |1 + √2| ≠ 1. It has absolute value q^{1/2} at one real embedding for q = (1 + √2)², so one embedding does not suffice.

- `isWeilNumber_inv_not_isIntegral`: For an integer q ≥ 2, q⁻¹ ∈ ℚ is a Weil q-number of weight −2 and is not integral over ℤ: purity and integrality are separate predicates.

- `isWeilNumber_rootOfUnity`: A root of unity is a Weil q-number of weight 0 for every q > 1; 0 is a Weil q-number of no weight.

### 0.2. Products, inverses, conjugation and integrality of Weil q-numbers

Let q > 1, and let α, β ∈ K be Weil q-numbers of weights n and m. (i) αβ is a Weil q-number of weight n + m, α⁻¹ one of weight −n, and α^k one of weight kn for k ∈ ℤ. (ii) If q is rational, q^k is a Weil q-number of weight 2k for k ∈ ℤ. (iii) If q is rational, then for every field homomorphism σ : K → ℂ the complex conjugate of σ(α) is q^n/σ(α). In particular α + q^n α⁻¹ is a totally real algebraic number. (iv) If α is integral over ℤ, then n ≥ 0, and if moreover n = 0 then α is a root of unity. A sum of Weil q-numbers is not a Weil q-number in general.

Scope: Products use embeddings of the common field ℚ(α,β). The reciprocal-conjugation formula uses rational q. The root-of-unity and nonnegative-weight conclusions require integrality.

Inputs: [0.1](#target-0-1), [B2](#input-b2), [B3](#input-b3).

### 0.3. Weil numbers under powers: change of q to q^r

Let q > 1, n ∈ ℤ and r ≥ 1. An element α of K is a Weil q-number of weight n if and only if α^r is a Weil q^r-number of weight n.

Scope: Require r≥1; algebraicity of α follows from that of α^r. Constant-field extension replaces (q,F) by (q^r,F^r).

Inputs: [0.1](#target-0-1), [B2](#input-b2).

### 0.4. ι-weights of nonzero elements of a coefficient field

Let E be a field, ι : E → ℂ a field homomorphism (not assumed continuous; Deligne takes an isomorphism ι : ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℂ), and q > 1 real. For α ∈ E^×, the ι-weight of α relative to q is w_{ι,q}(α) = 2 log_q |ι(α)| ∈ ℝ, so that |ι(α)| = q^{w/2}. α is ι-pure of weight β ∈ ℝ if w_{ι,q}(α) = β. The ι-weight is a group homomorphism E^× → ℝ: w(αβ) = w(α) + w(β) and w(α⁻¹) = −w(α). Moreover w_{ι,q}(q) = 2 when q ∈ ℚ, w_{ι,q^r}(α^r) = w_{ι,q}(α) for r ≥ 1, and w_{ι∘τ,q}(α) = w_{ι,q}(τ(α)) for a field homomorphism τ. A Weil q-number of weight n is ι-pure of weight n for every ι. An element of integer ι-weight need not be algebraic or a Weil q-number.

API:

- `iotaWeight`: The real number 2 log(|ια|)/log(q), with q>1 and α≠0.

- `IsIotaPure`: Nonvanishing and the specified real ι-weight.

- `iotaWeight_mul`: The ι-weight of a product of nonzero scalars is the sum of their weights.

- `iotaWeight_inv`: The ι-weight of an inverse is the negative of the weight.

- `iotaWeight_pow_base`: Raising α and q to the same positive integer power preserves the ι-weight.

- `iotaWeight_comp`: Composition of field embeddings transports the ι-weight.

- `norm_eq_rpow_iotaWeight`: For q>1 and α≠0, the modulus is q raised to half the ι-weight.

- `IsWeilNumber.isIotaPure`: A Weil number is ι-pure of its integer weight for every complex embedding.

Tests:

- `iotaWeight_q`: For q ∈ ℚ with q > 1 and every ι: w_{ι,q}(q) = 2 and w_{ι,q}(q⁻¹) = −2. So ℚ_ℓ(1), on which geometric Frobenius acts by q⁻¹, has weight −2.

- `iotaWeight_depends_on_iota`: For E = ℚ(√2) and q = 2, α = 1 + √2 has ι-weight 2 log₂(1 + √2) at one real embedding and −2 log₂(1 + √2) at the other: the ι-weight depends on ι.

- `iotaWeight_transcendental`: For E=ℚ(t), choose a transcendental complex number z of modulus √2 and send t to z. Then the ι-weight of t relative to 2 is 1, an integer, although t is not algebraic. The numeric test accepts the supplied transcendence and modulus conditions; no Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem is assumed.

- `iotaWeight_rootOfUnity`: w_{ι,q}(ζ) = 0 for every root of unity ζ ∈ E and every ι.

Inputs: [0.1](#target-0-1).

### 0.5. Embeddings into ℂ extending a given embedding, and isomorphisms ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℂ

(i) Let E be a field of characteristic 0 with #E ≤ 𝔠, k ⊆ E a countable subfield, and σ : k → ℂ a field homomorphism. Then σ extends to a field homomorphism E → ℂ. (ii) If moreover E is algebraically closed with #E = 𝔠, then σ extends to a field isomorphism E ≅ ℂ. (iii) For every prime ℓ, #ℚ_ℓ = #ℚ̄_ℓ = 𝔠. So field isomorphisms ι : ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℂ exist, and every embedding into ℂ of a number field K ⊂ ℚ̄_ℓ extends to one. (iv) If α ∈ E is transcendental over ℚ, then for every transcendental z ∈ ℂ there is a field homomorphism ι : E → ℂ with ι(α) = z, which is an isomorphism in case (ii).

Scope: The extension fixes the specified base embedding. It uses a transcendence basis and choice. The isomorphism assertion requires cardinality exactly 𝔠; a countable algebraically closed field is insufficient.

Inputs: [B4](#input-b4), [B5](#input-b5), [B2](#input-b2), [B6](#input-b6), [B7](#input-b7), [B8](#input-b8).

<a id="target-0-6"></a>

### 0.6. Algebraicity and Weil purity from ι-purity at every ι

Let E be a field of characteristic 0 with #E ≤ 𝔠 (for instance a finite extension of ℚ_ℓ, or ℚ̄_ℓ), q > 1 and n ∈ ℤ. For α ∈ E the following are equivalent: (a) α is a Weil q-number of weight n; (b) |ι(α)| = q^{n/2} for every field homomorphism ι : E → ℂ. If E is algebraically closed with #E = 𝔠, (b) may be restricted to field isomorphisms ι : E ≅ ℂ. In particular, an endomorphism that is ι-pure of weight n for every ι is pure of weight n.

Scope: Retain the cardinality bound and quantify over every embedding. One embedding does not force algebraicity or Weil purity.

Inputs: [0.1](#target-0-1), [0.4](#target-0-4), [0.5](#target-0-5).

### 0.7. Eigenvalues, Weil purity and ι-weights of an invertible endomorphism

Let E be a field of characteristic 0 with algebraic closure Ē, V a finite-dimensional E-vector space and F an invertible E-linear endomorphism of V. The eigenvalues of F are the roots of its characteristic polynomial det(T − F) in Ē, counted with multiplicity. The multiplicity of α equals the Ē-dimension of the maximal generalized eigenspace of F ⊗ Ē at α. (V, F) is pure of weight n relative to q if every eigenvalue is a Weil q-number of weight n. For a field homomorphism ι : Ē → ℂ, (V, F) is ι-pure of weight β ∈ ℝ if every eigenvalue has ι-weight β, and the ι-weights of (V, F) are the ι-weights of its eigenvalues, a finite subset of ℝ. The multiset of eigenvalues is stable under Aut(Ē/E), so none of these notions depends on the choice of Ē or of a splitting field inside Ē. V = 0 is pure of every weight and has no weights.

API:

- `eigenvalues`: The characteristic-root multiset in an algebraic closure, of cardinality dim V.

- `IsPure`: Every characteristic root is a Weil number of the specified integer weight.

- `IsIotaPureEnd`: Every characteristic root has the specified real ι-weight.

- `iotaWeights`: The finite set of real ι-weights of characteristic roots.

- `count_eigenvalues`: Root multiplicity is the dimension of its maximal generalized eigenspace after scalar extension.

- `eigenvalues_map_aut`: The characteristic-root multiset is invariant under every automorphism of the algebraic closure over the coefficient field.

- `isPure_baseChange_iff`: Purity is preserved and reflected under coefficient field extension; the ι-variant uses compatible closure embeddings.

- `IsPure.isIotaPureEnd`: Integer purity implies real ι-purity for every ι.

Tests:

- `isPure_jordanBlock`: F = [[q, 1], [0, q]] on E² is pure of weight 2 relative to q and is not semisimple: purity does not see Jordan blocks.

- `eigenvalues_rotation`: F = [[0, −q], [1, 0]] on ℚ² has characteristic polynomial T² + q, no eigenvalue in ℚ, eigenvalues ±i√q in ℚ̄, and is pure of weight 1.

- `not_isPure_diag`: F = diag(1, q) is not pure; its weights are {0, 2}.

- `isPure_zero_space`: On V = 0, F is pure of every weight and has no weights.

- `iotaWeights_singular_twist_rejection`: On a one-dimensional zero endomorphism F=0, the total log-based numeric iotaWeights core yields {0}. Multiplication by b=2 leaves F=0, so shifting by w₂(2)=2 would falsely give {2}. All iotaWeights_twist assertions therefore require invertible F; purity itself rejects the zero eigenvalue.

Inputs: [0.1](#target-0-1), [0.4](#target-0-4), [B9](#input-b9), [B10](#input-b10), [B11](#input-b11), [B12](#input-b12), [B13](#input-b13).

<a id="target-0-8"></a>

### 0.8. Multiplicativity of the characteristic polynomial along an invariant subspace

Let V be a finite-dimensional E-vector space, F ∈ End_E(V), and W ⊆ V an F-stable subspace, with induced endomorphisms F_W of W and F_{V/W} of V/W. Then det(T − F) = det(T − F_W)·det(T − F_{V/W}). Consequently det(1 − tF) = det(1 − tF_W)·det(1 − tF_{V/W}) and det F = det F_W · det F_{V/W}, and the eigenvalue multiset of F is the sum of those of F_W and F_{V/W}.

Scope: The chosen vector-space complement need not be F-stable; characteristic-polynomial factorization requires only stability of W.

Inputs: [B14](#input-b14), [B15](#input-b15).

Sources: [WI](#ref-wi), §1, (1.5.3), p. 276.

<a id="target-0-9"></a>

### 0.9. Purity and weights under subobjects, quotients, extensions and direct sums

Let F be an invertible endomorphism of V and W ⊆ V an F-stable subspace. (i) (V, F) is pure of weight n if and only if (W, F_W) and (V/W, F_{V/W}) are both pure of weight n; the same holds for ι-purity of weight β. (ii) The ι-weights of V are the union of those of W and of V/W, and likewise for a direct sum. (iii) So the pairs (V, F) that are pure of weight n form a class closed under subobjects, quotients and extensions.

Scope: Subobject and quotient actions are invertible by finite dimensionality. An extension of two pure modules of the same weight need not split.

Inputs: [0.7](#target-0-7), [0.8](#target-0-8).

Sources: [WII](#ref-wii), §1.2, Stabilités (1.2.5)(i), p. 154.

<a id="target-0-10"></a>

### 0.10. The characteristic power series det(1 − tF) and traces of powers

Let F be an endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space V over a field E. (i) det(1 − tF) ∈ E[t] is the reverse of det(T − F): det(1 − tF) = t^{dim V} det(t⁻¹ − F), and over Ē it is ∏(1 − αt) over the eigenvalues α. (ii) Writing D(t)=det(1−tF), in E[[t]] one has −tD′(t)/D(t)=Σ_{n≥1}Tr(F^n)t^n in every characteristic. When E has characteristic 0 this is t(d/dt)log D(t)⁻¹. (iii) If E has characteristic 0, the traces Tr(F^n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ dim V determine det(1 − tF), hence the eigenvalue multiset.

Scope: Recovering characteristic polynomials from all traces and taking a formal logarithm require characteristic zero. The logarithmic derivative is defined whenever the constant term is 1.

Inputs: [0.8](#target-0-8), [B16](#input-b16), [B17](#input-b17).

### 0.11. Eigenvalues of P(F), F^r and F⁻¹, with multiplicities

Let F be an endomorphism of a finite-dimensional E-vector space V with eigenvalue multiset {α₁, …, α_d} ⊂ Ē, and let P ∈ E[T]. Then the eigenvalue multiset of P(F) is {P(α₁), …, P(α_d)}, with multiplicities. In particular F^r has eigenvalues α_i^r (r ≥ 1), and if F is invertible, F⁻¹ has eigenvalues α_i⁻¹. The maximal generalized eigenspace of F at α is contained in that of P(F) at P(α).

Inputs: [0.7](#target-0-7), [B9](#input-b9), [B12](#input-b12), [B13](#input-b13), [B15](#input-b15), [B11](#input-b11), [B18](#input-b18).

Sources: [WI](#ref-wi), §1, (1.5.1), p. 275.

<a id="target-0-12"></a>

### 0.12. Weights under a finite extension of the finite base field

Let F be an invertible endomorphism of V, q > 1 and r ≥ 1. (V, F) is pure of weight n relative to q if and only if (V, F^r) is pure of weight n relative to q^r. For every ι, the ι-weights of F relative to q equal the ι-weights of F^r relative to q^r, with multiplicities. In the finite-field situation, passing from k₀ = 𝔽_q to its extension of degree r replaces the geometric Frobenius F by F^r and q by q^r, so the weights do not change. At a closed point x, F_x = F^{deg x} acts with base q_x = q^{deg x}.

Scope: Purity is reflected even if taking rth powers merges distinct eigenvalues.

Inputs: [0.3](#target-0-3), [0.4](#target-0-4), [0.11](#target-0-11).

### 0.13. Eigenvalues of tensor products, contragredients and Hom spaces

Let F and G be invertible endomorphisms of finite-dimensional E-spaces V and W, with eigenvalue multisets {α_i} and {β_j}. (i) F ⊗ G on V ⊗_E W has eigenvalue multiset {α_i β_j}. (ii) The transpose F^* on V^* has the eigenvalues of F. The contragredient F^∨ = (F⁻¹)^* has eigenvalues {α_i⁻¹}. (iii) On Hom_E(V, W), the endomorphism u ↦ G ∘ u ∘ F⁻¹ has eigenvalues {β_j α_i⁻¹}. (iv) F^{⊗k} on V^{⊗k} has as eigenvalues the products of k eigenvalues, and det F = ∏ α_i. Consequently, if V is pure of weight n and W of weight m, then V ⊗ W is pure of weight n + m, V^∨ of weight −n, Hom(V, W) of weight m − n, and V^{⊗k} of weight kn. The ι-weights behave in the same way.

Inputs: [0.7](#target-0-7), [0.11](#target-0-11), [0.2](#target-0-2), [B19](#input-b19), [B20](#input-b20), [B21](#input-b21).

### 0.14. Eigenvalues of exterior powers

Let F be an endomorphism of a d-dimensional E-space V, with eigenvalues α₁,…,α_d in an algebraic closure, listed with algebraic multiplicity. The eigenvalue multiset of ∧^k F consists of ∏_{i∈I}α_i for all k-element subsets I⊆{1,…,d}, once per subset of positions. In particular ∧^0 F has sole eigenvalue 1, ∧^d F has sole eigenvalue det F, and ∧^k V=0 for k>d. If F is invertible and pure of weight n, ∧^k F is pure of weight kn; real ι-weights are sums over those positions.

Inputs: [0.7](#target-0-7), [0.2](#target-0-2), [0.4](#target-0-4), [B28](#input-b28), [B29](#input-b29), [B9](#input-b9).

### 0.15. Twists V^{(b)} and Tate twists V(r)

For b ∈ E^× and an E-space V with invertible F, the twist is V^{(b)} = (V, bF) = V ⊗ E^{(b)}, where E^{(b)} is the rank-one space on which F acts by b (Weil II (1.2.7)). Its eigenvalues are the bα_i, and its ι-weights are those of V shifted by w_{ι,q}(b). With the geometric Frobenius convention, ℚ_ℓ(1) = E^{(q⁻¹)}, and the Tate twist V(r) = V ⊗ ℚ_ℓ(1)^{⊗r} = V^{(q^{−r})} (r ∈ ℤ) shifts weights by −2r. When E contains a square root q^{1/2}, the half twist V^{(q^{−1/2})} shifts weights by −1. It depends on the choice of q^{1/2}: the two choices differ by the twist by −1, of weight 0. Twisting is functorial and exact, satisfies V^{(b)} ⊗ W^{(c)} = (V ⊗ W)^{(bc)}, and dualizes as (V^{(b)})^∨ = (V^∨)^{(b⁻¹)}.

Scope: An arbitrary scalar gives a Weil line. Étale descent requires the separate unit/continuity criterion; a nonintegral real weight is not an integer Tate twist.

API:

- `twist`: Multiply the invertible Frobenius endomorphism by a nonzero scalar b.

- `tateTwist`: The integer twist multiplies geometric Frobenius by q^(−r).

- `eigenvalues_twist`: Multiplication by b multiplies every characteristic root by b.

- `iotaWeights_twist`: For an invertible endomorphism F, a nonzero scalar twist translates the weight set by the scalar’s ι-weight. The total numeric logarithm at zero does not satisfy this translation rule.

- `IsPure.tateTwist`: For a positive integral q, an integer Tate twist shifts a pure weight n to n−2r.

- `twist_tensor`: Scalar twists of tensor factors multiply their scalars.

- `twist_twist`: Two successive scalar twists equal the twist by the product.

- `tateTwist_weight`: ℚ_ℓ(1) = E^{(q⁻¹)} is pure of weight −2, and ℚ_ℓ(r) of weight −2r.

- `twist_one`: twist 1 F = F, and V(0) = V.

- `halfTwist_depends_on_sqrt`: The half twist depends on the square root: for V = E and F = 1, the choices q^{1/2} and −q^{1/2} give eigenvalues q^{−1/2} and −q^{−1/2}, non-isomorphic Frobenius modules, both of weight −1.

- `twist_nonintegral_weight`: For b with w_{ι,q}(b) = 1/2, for instance b transcendental with |ι(b)| = q^{1/4}, E^{(b)} is ι-pure of the non-integral weight 1/2 and is not pure in the sense of Weil numbers.

### 0.16. Eigenvalues under a Frobenius-equivariant perfect pairing

Let V and V′ be E-spaces of finite dimension d with invertible endomorphisms F and F′, and ⟨ , ⟩ : V × V′ → E a perfect bilinear pairing with ⟨Fx, F′y⟩ = c⟨x, y⟩ for some c ∈ E^×. Then: (i) under the isomorphism V′ ≅ V^* given by the pairing, F′ corresponds to c·(F⁻¹)^*; (ii) the eigenvalue multiset of F′ is {c/α_i}, and det(T − F′) = (−T)^d det(c/T − F) / det F; (iii) over Ē, the maximal generalized eigenspaces satisfy ⟨V_α, V′_β⟩ = 0 unless αβ = c, and the pairing restricts to a perfect pairing V_α × V′_{c/α} → Ē; (iv) if V is pure of weight n and c is a Weil q-number of weight w, then V′ is pure of weight w − n, and likewise for ι-weights. For V′ = V, the eigenvalue multiset of F is stable under α ↦ c/α.

Scope: The pairing is perfect and its target line has Frobenius scalar c. Generalized eigenspaces are used; self-pairing multiplicity parity and functional-equation signs belong to WC.2.

### 0.17. Disjoint spectra: no nonzero Frobenius-equivariant maps between different weights

Let F and G be endomorphisms of finite-dimensional E-spaces V and W whose characteristic polynomials have no common root in Ē, equivalently are coprime in E[T]. Then every E-linear u : V → W with u ∘ F = G ∘ u is zero. In particular: (i) if V is pure of weight n and W pure of weight m ≠ n, relative to q > 1, or ι-pure of weights β ≠ γ, then there is no nonzero equivariant map V → W; (ii) if W ⊆ V is F-stable, with W pure of weight n and V/W pure of weight m ≠ n, then W has a unique F-stable complement.

Scope: Require q>1 to separate weights. Equal weights permit both nonzero maps and nonsplit extensions.

### 0.18. Decomposition of a Frobenius module by weights

Let F be an invertible endomorphism of a finite-dimensional E-space V, and q > 1. (i) If every eigenvalue of F is a Weil q-number, then V = ⊕_n V_n, a finite sum over n ∈ ℤ. Here V_n = ker P_n(F), and P_n ∈ E[T] is the monic polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues of weight n, with their multiplicities. Each V_n is F-stable and pure of weight n, and det(T − F) = ∏ P_n. (ii) For ι : Ē → ℂ the same holds over Ē with real weights: V ⊗ Ē = ⊕_β (V ⊗ Ē)_β. (iii) The decompositions are functorial: an equivariant map V → W maps V_n into W_n.

Scope: Integer-weight factors descend to the perfect coefficient field E. Fixed-ι real-weight summands may exist only after coefficient extension. Each summand may be nonsemisimple.

## DWP.1 — The initial Weil estimate through Rosati positivity

Apply the imported Rosati involution and positivity to the q-Frobenius endomorphism. Its Tate realization gives the initial estimate without relying on either later purity theorem. The curve comparison uses the Jacobian H¹ interface with the correct Frobenius normalization.

### 1.1. The q-Frobenius endomorphism of a variety over 𝔽_q

Import scheme Frobenius from SF.0 and instantiate its q-power iterate over 𝔽_q. Let V be a variety (a separated scheme of finite type) over 𝔽_q. The q-Frobenius π_V : V → V is the identity on the underlying space and f ↦ f^q on the structure sheaf. It is an 𝔽_q-morphism. It commutes with every 𝔽_q-morphism φ : W → V, that is φ ∘ π_W = π_V ∘ φ, and on V(𝔽̄_q) it acts by raising coordinates to the q-th power, so V(𝔽_{q^m}) is the fixed-point set of π_V^m. Its differential is 0. For an abelian variety A over 𝔽_q, π_A fixes 0 and is an endomorphism of A, of degree q^g. After extending scalars to 𝔽_{q^m}, the Frobenius is π_A^m.

Scope: For q=p^a, use the qth-power iterate of scheme Frobenius. Its geometric-point action is arithmetic Frobenius; its pullback on étale cohomology is geometric Frobenius.

API:

- `frobeniusEndo`: The supplied scheme q-Frobenius, viewed as an endomorphism over 𝔽_q.

- `frobeniusEndo_comp`: The q-Frobenius commutes with every morphism over 𝔽_q.

- `fixedPoints_frobeniusEndo_pow`: The fixed points of the mth Frobenius power on geometric points are the points over 𝔽_(q^m), for m≥1.

- `frobeniusEndo_baseChange`: Relative Frobenius after degree-m constant extension is the scalar extension of the mth original power.

- `AbelianVariety.frobenius`: The group endomorphism on an abelian variety induced by its supplied scheme Frobenius.

Tests:

- `frobeniusEndo_projectiveLine_fixed`: The fixed points of π on ℙ¹(𝔽̄_q) are the q + 1 points of ℙ¹(𝔽_q).

- `frobeniusEndo_spec_field`: On Spec 𝔽_q, π is the identity.

- `frobeniusEndo_not_absolute`: For q = p², π_V is the square of the absolute Frobenius, not the absolute Frobenius itself; its fixed points on 𝔸¹(𝔽̄_q) are 𝔽_{p²}, not 𝔽_p.

- `deg_frobenius_elliptic`: For an elliptic curve over 𝔽_q, deg π_E = q.

### 1.2. Milne II.1.2: π†π = q

Let A be an abelian variety over 𝔽_q, λ a polarization of A defined over 𝔽_q, and † the Rosati involution of λ. Then π_A^† ∘ π_A = q in End⁰(A), that is π_A^∨ ∘ λ ∘ π_A = q·λ.

Scope: The polarization is defined over 𝔽_q. The imported duality identifies the dual Frobenius with Verschiebung through this polarization.

### 1.3. Milne II.1.3: α†α = r forces |a|² = r for the roots of P_α

Let A be an abelian variety over a field k with a polarization and Rosati involution †, and α ∈ End⁰(A) with α†α = r ∈ ℤ_{>0}. Then ℚ[α] is a product of fields, stable under †, and † acts on each real factor of ℚ[α] ⊗ ℝ as the identity and on each complex factor as complex conjugation. Every root a of P_α in ℂ satisfies |a|² = r.

Scope: Use Rosati positivity on the commutative algebra ℚ[α], independently of Tate isogeny or cohomological purity.

### 1.4. The Weil estimate for abelian varieties over 𝔽_q

Let A be an abelian variety of dimension g over 𝔽_q. Every root of the characteristic polynomial P_{π_A} ∈ ℤ[X] is a Weil q-number of weight 1: all its complex conjugates have absolute value q^{1/2}. Equivalently, for every ℓ ∤ q, the geometric Frobenius on H¹(A_{𝔽̄_q}, ℚ_ℓ) is pure of weight 1, and the geometric Frobenius on V_ℓA is pure of weight −1. The same holds for π_A^m relative to q^m.

Scope: The comparison identifies arithmetic Frobenius on V_ℓA with π_A, and geometric Frobenius on H¹ with its inverse dual. The Rosati proof precedes DWP.4.

### 1.5. Point counts of abelian varieties over 𝔽_{q^m}, and their bounds

Let A be an abelian variety of dimension g over 𝔽_q with P_{π_A}(X) = ∏_{i=1}^{2g}(X − a_i). Then for all m ≥ 1, N_m = #A(𝔽_{q^m}) = deg(1 − π^m) = P_{π^m}(1) = ∏_i(1 − a_i^m), and |N_m − q^{mg}| ≤ 2g·q^{m(g−1/2)} + (2^{2g} − 2g − 1)·q^{m(g−1)}. The zeta function is Z(A, t) = ∏_{r=0}^{2g} P_r(t)^{(−1)^{r+1}}, where P_r(t) = ∏(1 − a_{i_1}⋯a_{i_r}t) over 1 ≤ i_1 < … < i_r ≤ 2g, the characteristic polynomial of π on ∧^r T_ℓA.

Scope: The differential of 1−π^m is the identity, giving separability and the kernel count. The exact leading product is q^g.

### 1.6. The Weil estimate for curves, through the Jacobian

Let C be a smooth projective geometrically connected curve of genus g over 𝔽_q, J its Jacobian, and P_{π_J}(X) = ∏(X − a_i). Then #C(𝔽_{q^m}) = 1 − Σ_i a_i^m + q^m for all m ≥ 1, the a_i are Weil q-numbers of weight 1, |#C(𝔽_{q^m}) − q^m − 1| ≤ 2g·q^{m/2}, and Z(C, t) = P_{π_J}^{rev}(t)/((1 − t)(1 − qt)) with P^{rev}(t) = ∏(1 − a_i t).

Scope: Geometric connectedness is essential: conjugate components change counts. Use the imported curve/Jacobian fixed-point trace comparison.

### 1.7. The weights of H⁰, H¹ and H² of a curve over 𝔽_q

Let C be a smooth projective geometrically connected curve of genus g over 𝔽_q, and ℓ ∤ q. Then H⁰(C_{𝔽̄_q}, ℚ_ℓ) = ℚ_ℓ is pure of weight 0, H²(C_{𝔽̄_q}, ℚ_ℓ) ≅ ℚ_ℓ(−1) is pure of weight 2, and H¹(C_{𝔽̄_q}, ℚ_ℓ) ≅ H¹(J_{𝔽̄_q}, ℚ_ℓ) ≅ (V_ℓJ)^∨ is pure of weight 1, with the geometric Frobenius having characteristic polynomial P_{π_J}. The same holds after any finite extension of 𝔽_q.

Scope: The Abel–Jacobi H¹ comparison is Frobenius-equivariant without assuming a rational base point. Permuted components give a nontrivial weight-zero H⁰ permutation action.

Inputs: [1.4](#target-1-4), [0.15](#target-0-15), [E11](#input-e11), [E61](#input-e61), [0.12](#target-0-12), [E19](#input-e19).

### 1.8. Compatibility with the Hasse bound for elliptic curves

For an elliptic curve E over 𝔽_q with a = q + 1 − #E(𝔽_q) (the trace of Frobenius of Tau Ceti EllipticCurves Layer 3), P_{π_E}(X) = X² − aX + q, and the Weil estimate for abelian varieties (g = 1) gives |a| ≤ 2√q. This is the Hasse bound that Tau Ceti EllipticCurves Layer 3 proves independently. The two agree, and this target proves only the identification of the characteristic polynomials.

Scope: Import the Hasse theorem from EllipticCurves Layer 3; the target is identification with the characteristic polynomial used here.

### 1.9. Compatibility of the Weil estimate with finite base extension

For A (resp. C) over 𝔽_q and m ≥ 1, the Frobenius of A ⊗ 𝔽_{q^m} over 𝔽_{q^m} is π_A^m, P_{π^m}(X) = ∏(X − a_i^m), and the Weil estimate over 𝔽_{q^m} (weight 1 relative to q^m) is equivalent to that over 𝔽_q (weight 1 relative to q). The same holds for the weights of H⁰, H¹ and H² of curves.

Inputs: [1.1](#target-1-1), [0.12](#target-0-12), [0.3](#target-0-3).

Sources: [AV](#ref-av), Chapter II, proof of Theorem 1.1, p. 76.

## DWP.2 — The symplectic tensor-power estimate

Use an open symplectic geometric image and its even-tensor coinvariants. Rational local factors make the tensor-power traces nonnegative; the nearest-pole argument bounds their eigenvalues. Letting the tensor degree grow removes the error term. The pairing supplies the reciprocal lower bound.

<a id="target-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. The Weil I curve coefficient interface

On an open U₀⊂ℙ¹ over 𝔽_q, specialize DWP.5’s common punctual purity predicate to a lisse ℚ_ℓ-sheaf ℱ₀: integer weight β means each closed-point stalk is pure β relative to q^(deg x). The local determinant and Euler product are the WC.1/SF.2 coefficient L-function, with local variable t^(deg x). Changing geometric stalk conjugates Frobenius and leaves its determinant unchanged; tensor weights add, dual weights negate, and the Tate line ℚ_ℓ(r) has weight −2r. This comparison fixes the inputs of Weil I §3 without defining a second purity predicate or L-function.

Scope: Keep the fixed ℚ_ℓ model; ℚ̄_ℓ is used for characteristic roots. This is the DWP.5 predicate specialized to open subsets of ℙ¹.

### 2.2. Open subgroups of Sp(V)(ℚ_ℓ) are Zariski-dense

Let V be a finite-dimensional ℚ_ℓ-vector space with a nondegenerate alternating form ψ, and H ⊆ Sp(V, ψ)(ℚ_ℓ) a subgroup open for the ℓ-adic topology. Then H is Zariski-dense in the algebraic group Sp(V, ψ). Consequently, for every algebraic representation W of Sp(V, ψ), such as ⊗^m V, the H-invariants and H-coinvariants of W are the Sp(V, ψ)-invariants and Sp(V, ψ)-coinvariants.

Scope: The open subgroup uses the ℓ-adic topology. Connectedness of Sp is essential; an open subgroup of a disconnected orthogonal group need not be Zariski-dense in every component.

### 2.3. Coinvariants of ⊗^{2k}V under the symplectic group, over ℚ_ℓ

Let V be a ℚ_ℓ-vector space of dimension 2r ≥ 2 with a nondegenerate alternating form ψ : V ⊗ V → L, where L is one-dimensional (L = ℚ_ℓ(−β)). For a partition P of {1, …, 2k} into pairs {a_i, b_i} with a_i < b_i, let ψ_P : ⊗^{2k}V → L^{⊗k}, v₁ ⊗ … ⊗ v_{2k} ↦ ∏_i ψ(v_{a_i}, v_{b_i}). The ψ_P span the Sp(V, ψ)-invariant maps ⊗^{2k}V → L^{⊗k}. For a suitable subset 𝒫′ of the pair partitions, depending on dim V and k, the ψ_P with P ∈ 𝒫′ induce an isomorphism (⊗^{2k}V)_{Sp(V, ψ)} ≅ (L^{⊗k})^N with N = #𝒫′ ≥ 1. The isomorphism is compatible with every automorphism of V that multiplies ψ by a scalar, acting on L by that scalar.

Scope: Transfer the algebraic invariant theory from ℚ to ℚ_ℓ by flat base change. In the stable range dim V≥2k all pair partitions are independent; below it choose an independent subset.

So Z(U₀, ⊗^{2k}F₀, t) is the Taylor expansion of a rational function whose only poles are at t = q^{−kβ−1}.

Assume (i) F₀ carries a nondegenerate alternating pairing ψ : F₀ ⊗ F₀ → ℚ_ℓ(−β); (ii) the image of the geometric fundamental group π₁(U, ū) in GL(F_ū) is an open subgroup of Sp(F_ū, ψ); (iii) for every x ∈ |U₀|, det(1 − F_x t, F₀) has rational coefficients. Then F₀ has weight β: every eigenvalue of every F_x is an algebraic number all of whose complex conjugates have absolute value q_x^{β/2}.

Scope: Use openness in Sp, rational local factors of the fixed ℚ_ℓ sheaf, and the specified pairing; the proof proceeds without a cohomological purity input.

## DWP.3 — Rational local factors of a Lefschetz pencil

Descend the vanishing-system radical and pairing to the finite field, and isolate its local factors from the zeta functions of the pencil fibres. Open arithmetic monodromy and a Haar-null exceptional locus feed the function-field density argument. Rationality is the output needed by the fundamental estimate, rather than an assumed coefficient property of the vanishing quotient.

### 3.1. Arithmetic descent of the pencil radical quotient

For a finite-field Lefschetz pencil on a geometrically connected smooth projective even-dimensional variety, the LPV.4 vanishing system ℰ and its radical quotient ℱ=ℰ/(ℰ∩ℰ⊥) descend to lisse ℚ_ℓ-sheaves ℰ₀ and ℱ₀ over the smooth-parameter open U₀. The supplied perfect alternating pairing on ℱ₀ has values in ℚ_ℓ(−d), with d odd the fixed fibre dimension, so a local geometric Frobenius of degree e acts by a symplectic similitude with multiplier q^(de). The zero quotient is permitted. LPV.4 owns the construction and perfection of the quotient; this target supplies its finite-field descent and arithmetic normalization.

Let U₀ be geometrically connected over 𝔽_q and let 𝒢₀ be a lisse ℚ_ℓ-sheaf on U₀ whose pullback 𝒢 to U is constant. Then there are ℓ-adic units α_i ∈ ℚ̄_ℓ with det(1 − F_x t^{deg x}, 𝒢₀) = ∏_i(1 − α_i^{deg x} t^{deg x}) for every x ∈ |U₀|. In fact 𝒢₀ is the pullback of its direct image to Spec 𝔽_q, a representation G₀ of Gal(𝔽̄_q/𝔽_q), and ∏(1 − α_i t) = det(1 − F t, G₀).

### 3.3. The zeta functions of the fibres, split into a constant part and the ℱ₀ part

In the setting of [3.1](#target-3-1), there are ℓ-adic units α_1, …, α_N and β_1, …, β_M in ℚ̄_ℓ, with α_i ≠ β_j for all i and j, such that for every x ∈ |U₀|, Z(X_x, t) = [∏_i(1 − α_i^{deg x} t) / ∏_j(1 − β_j^{deg x} t)] · det(1 − F_x t, ℱ₀)^{(−1)^{n+1}}, where t is the variable for the residue field k(x). In particular the right-hand side lies in ℚ(t).

Scope: Cancel common α_i and β_j first. Rationality of the fibre zeta functions is an input, while their purity is not.

Let K be a finite set of nonnegative integers different from 1, and (δ_j)_{j ≤ Q}, (ε_j)_{j ≤ Q} two families of elements of a field. If, for all sufficiently large n divisible by no element of K, the families (δ_j^n) and (ε_j^n) agree up to order, then (δ_j) and (ε_j) agree up to order.

Scope: The finite families retain multiplicities and the excluded divisor set does not contain 1.

Inputs: finite multisets and powers in a field.

### 3.5. Weil I Lemma 6.11: the arithmetic monodromy of ℱ₀ is open in H

Let d be the fixed odd pencil fibre dimension and ℱ₀≠0 its supplied radical quotient with pairing into ℚ_ℓ(−d). Use the arithmetic coordinate a∈ℤ̂, where geometric Frobenius of a degree-e point has a=−e. In a fixed finite ℓ-adic coefficient model define H={(a,g)∈ℤ̂×GSp(ℱ,ψ): μ(g)=q^(−da)}. Then (arithmetic degree,ρ):π₁(U₀)→H has open image H₁, compact because π₁(U₀) is profinite. Its degree-zero image is open in Sp for the ℓ-adic topology.

### 3.6. Weil I Lemma 6.12: the eigenvalue-δ^a locus is closed and Haar-null

For an ℓ-adic unit δ in the fixed finite coefficient field, the locus Z_δ={(a,g)∈H₁: δ^a is an eigenvalue of g} is closed and null in each arithmetic-degree fibre, hence Haar-null in H₁. For a bad geometric eigenvalue δ₀^e the arithmetic-degree locus uses δ=δ₀⁻¹, since a(F_x)=−e.

Scope: The unit condition defines δ^a for a∈ℤ̂. A zero quotient has empty eigenvalue locus.

### 3.7. The Frobenius elements landing in a Haar-null set have density zero

Let δ_1, …, δ_Q be ℓ-adic units. The set L of x ∈ |U₀| such that some δ_j^{deg x} is an eigenvalue of F_x on ℱ₀ has Dirichlet density 0. More precisely, the proportion of the closed points of degree n that lie in L tends to 0 as n → ∞. In particular, for every sufficiently large n there are closed points of degree n outside L.

Scope: Use finite-quotient Chebotarev with constant-field congruences, then approximate the closed null locus by open neighbourhoods of arbitrarily small Haar measure.

### 3.8. Weil I Proposition 6.6: the denominator of (6.6.1) away from K and L

Let (γ_i)_{i ≤ P} and (δ_j)_{j ≤ Q} be families of ℓ-adic units with γ_i ≠ δ_j. There are a finite set K of nonnegative integers different from 1 and a density-zero set L ⊂ |U₀| such that, for x ∉ L with deg x divisible by no element of K, the rational function det(1 − F_x t, ℱ₀)·∏_i(1 − γ_i^{deg x} t) / ∏_j(1 − δ_j^{deg x} t), written in lowest terms, has denominator ∏_j(1 − δ_j^{deg x} t).

Let (γ_i)_{i ≤ P} and (δ_j)_{j ≤ Q} be families of ℓ-adic units, R(t) = ∏(1 − γ_i t) and S(t) = ∏(1 − δ_j t). If, for every x ∈ |U₀|, ∏_j(1 − δ_j^{deg x} t) divides ∏_i(1 − γ_i^{deg x} t)·det(1 − F_x t, ℱ₀), then S(t) divides R(t). Consequently R(t) is the least common multiple of the S(t) satisfying this hypothesis, which characterises the γ-family intrinsically from the polynomials ∏(1 − γ_i^{deg x}t)·det(1 − F_x t, ℱ₀).

In the setting of [3.1](#target-3-1), for every x ∈ |U₀|, det(1 − F_x t, ℱ₀) ∈ ℚ[t].

Scope: The zero quotient has factor 1; the nonzero case uses rational zeta functions, open monodromy and Chebotarev.

## DWP.4 — Smooth projective purity by induction and Cartesian powers

The first reduction gives a half-unit error in even middle dimension. Large even Cartesian powers divide that error by the power, and duality removes the remaining lower discrepancy. Weak Lefschetz and the pencil Leray sequence then recover all degrees.

<a id="target-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. The half-unit bound in even dimension

Let X₀ be smooth projective of pure even dimension d over 𝔽_q, ℓ ≠ char 𝔽_q. Every eigenvalue α of geometric Frobenius on Hᵈ(X,ℚ_ℓ) is algebraic; every complex conjugate satisfies q^(d/2−1/2) ≤ |α| ≤ q^(d/2+1/2). No semisimplicity or degeneration of Leray is required. The induction retains E∩E⊥ and covers zero vanishing cycles, a zero radical quotient, and a nonzero quotient.

### 5.1. The Weil group of a finite-field scheme

For connected X₀/𝔽_q with geometric point x, let W(X₀,x)=π₁(X₀,x)×_{Gal(𝔽̄_q/𝔽_q)}ℤ, where 1∈ℤ maps to geometric Frobenius. Its topology makes the geometric kernel open with its profinite topology and the degree quotient discrete. For geometrically connected X₀ the sequence 1→π₁(X,x)→W(X₀,x)→ℤ→0 is exact. A closed-point geometric Frobenius has degree +deg(x). This degree is the negative of the arithmetic coordinate in Weil I §6.

API:

- `WeilGroup`: The topological pullback group with its projection to π₁ and its geometric-degree homomorphism to ℤ.

- `WeilGroup.degree`: The integer degree of a Weil element.

- `WeilGroup.geometricKernel`: The degree-zero subgroup is the geometric fundamental group for geometrically connected X₀.

- `WeilGroup.frobenius_degree`: The local geometric Frobenius has degree deg(x).

- `WeilGroup.baseExtension`: Over 𝔽_(qᵃ), the Weil group is the subgroup of degrees divisible by a, with the new degree divided by a.

Tests:

- `weilGroup_point`: For Spec 𝔽_q, W=ℤ with degree the identity and trivial geometric kernel.

- `weilGroup_degree_sign`: A local geometric Frobenius of degree e has Weil II degree e and Weil I arithmetic coordinate −e.

- `weilGroup_base_extension_two`: For Spec 𝔽_(q²) over 𝔽_q, arithmetic degrees lie in 2ℤ; degree-one relative Frobenius maps to degree 2.

### 5.2. Weil sheaves and étale descent

A constructible Weil sheaf on X₀/𝔽_q is a constructible ℚ̄_ℓ-sheaf on X=X₀×𝔽̄_q together with compatible Weil descent isomorphisms; equivalently an isomorphism F*ℱ≅ℱ for the chosen geometric-Frobenius descent action. For a lisse sheaf on connected X this is a continuous finite-coefficient-model representation of W(X₀,x). An ordinary étale sheaf requires extension of that representation to continuous π₁(X₀,x); a Frobenius isomorphism alone does not ensure it. On a point a rank-one Weil action with scalar b descends étale exactly when b is an ℓ-adic unit.

API:

- `WeilSheaf`: A geometric constructible sheaf with Weil descent data.

- `WeilSheaf.frobenius`: The invertible action on every closed-point stalk, up to conjugacy.

- `WeilSheaf.ofEtale`: Restrict an étale sheaf to Weil descent.

- `WeilSheaf.etaleDescent_iff`: For a lisse Weil sheaf, étale descent means extension to a continuous arithmetic fundamental-group representation. Constructible non-lisse sheaves instead use sheaf descent data; a single representation does not describe them.

- `WeilSheaf.pullback`: Pull back descent along an 𝔽_q-morphism, preserving identity and composition.

Tests:

- `weilSheaf_nonunit`: On Spec 𝔽_q the scalar ℓ defines a Weil line which has no étale descent.

- `weilSheaf_constant`: The constant line with Frobenius 1 descends étale.

- `weilSheaf_tate`: For ℓ≠p the Tate line has geometric scalar q⁻¹ and agrees with EDC.0, hence descends étale.

### 5.3. Punctual purity and finite mixed filtrations

Let ℓ be prime and X be of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ]; use constructible ℚ̄_ℓ-sheaves, or Weil sheaves when X is over a finite field. Punctual purity of integer weight n requires every geometric-Frobenius eigenvalue at each closed point x to be a Weil N(x)-number of weight n. Fixed-ι punctual purity of real weight β uses |ια|=N(x)^(β/2). Mixedness, respectively ι-mixedness, means existence of a finite filtration by subsheaves with pure, respectively ι-pure, successive quotients. Actual weights are the weights of nonzero quotients; the zero sheaf has no actual weights. Bounds ≤b or ≥b apply to these actual weights. Weight classes modulo ℤ are real weights in ℝ/ℤ; the canonical decomposition into those classes belongs to DWP.8.

API:

- `IsPunctuallyPure`: Integer purity at all closed stalks.

- `IsPunctuallyIotaPure`: Real purity at all closed stalks for a specified coefficient isomorphism ι.

- `IsMixed`: Existence of a finite integer-pure subsheaf filtration.

- `IsIotaMixed`: Existence of a finite real-ι-pure subsheaf filtration.

- `punctualWeights`: The finite set of actual weights of nonzero graded pieces.

- `pure_zero`: The zero sheaf is pure of every weight and has empty actual weight set.

- `pure_subquotient`: Subsheaves and quotient sheaves of a pure sheaf are pure of the same weight.

- `mixed_extension`: An extension of mixed sheaves is mixed; actual weights form the union.

- `pure_tensor`: Tensor products add weights; lisse duals negate them.

- `pure_tateTwist`: Twisting by r∈ℤ subtracts 2r.

- `pure_pullback_finitePushforward`: Pullback and finite direct image preserve purity, with residue-degree powers of Frobenius included.

- `mixed_iff_finite_filtration`: Mixedness is precisely a finite subsheaf filtration with pure quotients, with no strictness or canonical splitting built into the predicate.

Tests:

- `punctual_tate_line`: ℚ̄_ℓ(1) is pure of weight −2.

- `punctual_zero_weights`: The zero sheaf is pure of every weight, mixed, and has empty actual weight set.

- `mixed_two_tate_weights`: ℚ̄_ℓ⊕ℚ̄_ℓ(−1) on Spec 𝔽_q is mixed with actual weights {0,2}, and is not pure of any weight.

- `punctual_jordan`: The rank-two unipotent Jordan Frobenius on a point is pure of weight 0 although arithmetic Frobenius is not semisimple.

### 5.4. Totally real and ι-real sheaves

A lisse sheaf is totally real when every closed-point local characteristic polynomial has algebraic totally real coefficients; it is ι-real when those coefficients map into ℝ under the fixed ι. These are coefficient conditions, not assertions that every eigenvalue is real. A punctually pure lisse sheaf of integer weight n is a direct summand of the totally real sheaf ℱ⊕ℱ∨(−n); for real ι-weight β use a rank-one Weil twist of weight 2β in place of the integer Tate normalization.

API:

- `IsTotallyReal`: All local polynomial coefficients are algebraic and totally real.

- `IsIotaReal`: All local polynomial coefficients become real under ι.

- `totallyReal_iotaReal`: Total reality implies ι-reality for every ι.

- `pure_real_envelope`: The reciprocal-normalized dual direct sum of a punctually pure lisse sheaf is real and contains the original as a direct summand.

Tests:

- `real_nonreal_roots`: A point module with polynomial T²−T+2 is totally real, although its roots are nonreal.

- `real_zero`: The zero object has local polynomial 1 and is totally real.

- `real_envelope_line`: A pure weight-zero line with scalar (3+4i)/5 has real envelope polynomial T²−(6/5)T+1.

### 5.5. Finite geometric monodromy and rank-one normalization

For normal geometrically connected X₀/𝔽_q, the image of π₁(X) in the abelianization of W(X₀) is an extension of a finite prime-to-p group by a pro-p group. Consequently every rank-one ℓ-adic Weil representation (ℓ≠p, finite coefficient model) has finite geometric image and is a constant Weil character times a finite-order character; it is punctually ι-pure. An irreducible rank-r system becomes finite-determinant after a rank-one Weil twist. Choosing a twist of arbitrary real weight uses Weil lines and does not assert that it is a motivic Tate twist.

Inputs: [5.1](#target-5-1), [5.2](#target-5-2), [0.15](#target-0-15), [E24](#input-e24), [E27](#input-e27), [E40](#input-e40), [5.15](#target-5-15).

<a id="target-5-6"></a>

### 5.6. Determinantal weights of irreducible constituents

For a lisse Weil sheaf on normal connected X₀, an irreducible constituent ℱ of rank r has determinantal ι-weight β when det ℱ is punctually ι-pure of weight rβ. The determinantal-weight multiset of any lisse sheaf lists these β with constituent multiplicities. It is independent of a Jordan–Hölder filtration. It is not the multiset of all stalk weights until purity of constituents has been proved.

API:

- `determinantalWeight`: For an irreducible of rank r>0, the determinant weight divided by r.

- `determinantalWeights`: The multiset of determinantal weights of irreducible constituents.

- `determinantalWeight_det`: The determinant is pure of weight r times the determinantal weight.

- `determinantalWeights_exact`: The multiset for an extension is the sum of those of its subobject and quotient.

- `determinantalWeights_twist`: A rank-one twist of weight c adds c to every determinantal weight.

### 5.7. Unipotent radical and central degree in Weil monodromy

For a lisse finite-model Weil system on normal geometrically connected X₀, let G_geom be the Zariski closure of geometric monodromy and G the algebraic-by-discrete extension G_geom⋊ℤ induced by a degree-one lift. The radical of G_geom° is unipotent. If the system is semisimple as a Weil representation, its geometric restriction is semisimple and G_geom° is semisimple. Then degree on Z(G) has finite kernel and image of finite index in ℤ. For a central g of degree m≠0, the spectrum on the determinantal-weight-β constituent has |ια|=q^(mβ/2). Every irreducible Weil system becomes an étale system after a rank-one Weil twist.

### 5.8. Functoriality of determinantal weights

For a dominant morphism f:X′₀→X₀ of normal connected finite-type schemes over 𝔽_q, a lisse Weil sheaf has only determinantal ι-weight β if and only if its pullback does. Tensor products of sheaves having only determinantal weights β and γ have only weight β+γ. If n(β) is the sum of ranks of constituents of weight β, the determinantal weights occurring in ∧^aℱ are exactly Σ_β a(β)β with Σ a(β)=a and 0≤a(β)≤n(β), as a set of occurring weights (not constituent multiplicities).

Scope: Use a common finite coefficient model. Exterior degree above total rank has no weights; exterior degree zero has weight 0.

For a normal connected X₀ of finite type over 𝔽_q, the irreducible constituents of a lisse ι-real sheaf are punctually ι-pure. More precisely, on a smooth curve let r be its maximal determinantal weight; every stalk eigenvalue has ι-weight ≤r, and each irreducible constituent of determinantal weight β is punctually pure of weight β. No open symplectic-image or rational-coefficient hypothesis is imposed.

### 5.10. Initial cohomological and boundary weight bounds

For j:U₀→C₀ with C₀ smooth projective over 𝔽_q and ℱ lisse punctually ι-pure of real weight β, boundary eigenvalues of j_*ℱ have ι-weight ≤β, and those on H¹_c(U,ℱ) have weight ≤β+2. These initial non-strict bounds precede the strict analytic bound and the sharp curve theorem.

Then GrᵢᴹV is pure of weight β+i relative to the residue cardinality. With N:V→V(−1), geometric F satisfies FNF⁻¹=q_x⁻¹N in untwisted coordinates. The inertia invariants have only weights ≤β. This is an equal-characteristic curve theorem.

### 5.12. Boundary mixedness and extension of purity

For an ι-mixed local system on a smooth curve, the relative monodromy filtration exists and agrees with the local weight filtration on pure graded pieces. Along a smooth divisor, the relative construction is lisse and compatible with transverse curves and fibres under the tame hypotheses of (1.8.6)–(1.8.7). For an open immersion of finite-type 𝔽_q schemes, underived j_* takes ι-mixed sheaves with weights ≤β to ι-mixed sheaves with weights ≤β. A lisse sheaf pure on a dense open is pure everywhere; on normal X a lisse ι-mixed sheaf has a finite filtration by lisse pure sheaves. On connected X an ι-mixed lisse sheaf pure of weight β at one closed point is pure of weight β everywhere.

### 5.13. Newton polygons of Frobenius stalks

Fix a rational-valued additive nonarchimedean valuation v on the coefficient algebraic closure normalized by v(p)=1. For a rank-r closed stalk at x with geometric Frobenius eigenvalues α₁,…,αᵣ, let s₁≤…≤sᵣ be v(αᵢ)/v(N(x)), counted with multiplicity. Its Newton polygon has vertices (k,Σ_{i≤k}sᵢ), k=0,…,r, and linear interpolation. Equivalently the kth ordinate is the minimum normalized valuation of products of k distinct eigenvalue positions, the spectrum of the kth exterior power. This is the stalk specialization of the general Newton-polygon convention, not a new p-adic cohomology theory.

API:

- `stalkNewtonPolygon`: The cumulative-slope polygon normalized by v(N(x)).

- `stalkNewtonPolygon_zero`: The origin is (0,0); rank zero has the single origin.

- `stalkNewtonPolygon_endpoint`: The endpoint is (r,v(det F_x)/v(N(x))).

- `stalkNewtonPolygon_exterior`: The kth ordinate is the minimum normalized valuation of kth exterior eigenvalues.

- `stalkNewtonPolygon_baseExtension`: Finite residue-field extension leaves the polygon unchanged.

- `stalkNewtonPolygon_tateTwist`: Twisting by a adds −a to every normalized slope.

Tests:

- `newton_two_slopes`: The point module diag(1,q) has vertices (0,0),(1,0),(2,1).

- `newton_empty`: Rank zero has only (0,0).

- `newton_base_extension`: Replacing diag(1,q) by diag(1,q²) over 𝔽_(q²) retains slopes 0,1, not 0,2.

### 5.14. Nonarchimedean bounds at the boundary

Fix an embedding ι of the coefficient field into an algebraically closed nonarchimedean valued field of characteristic zero. For a lisse Weil sheaf on a smooth curve, a normalized nonarchimedean bound b^(deg x)≤|ια|≤c^(deg x) at closed points extends to every eigenvalue of its local boundary Weil representations. Generic ℓ′-adic units remain units at the boundary. For valuations with v(p)>0, if almost all stalk Newton polygons agree, the boundary polygon lies on or above that polygon with the same endpoint. If local normalized slopes lie in [β,γ], N^(⌊γ−β⌋+1)=0.

Inputs: [5.13](#target-5-13), [5.11](#target-5-11), [5.5](#target-5-5), [0.13](#target-0-13), [0.14](#target-0-14).

### 5.15. Specialization of geometric monodromy

Let f:X→S be smooth with geometrically connected curve fibres, S reduced irreducible with generic point η, and g:S→X a section. For a lisse ℤ_ℓ-sheaf ℱ, after shrinking S to a nonempty open there is, simultaneously for every n, a lisse subgroup of Aut(g*ℱ/ℓⁿ) whose stalk is the image of the geometric fibre fundamental group. If f has a smooth proper curve compactification with boundary finite étale over S, the image is locally constant without further shrinking under the stated tame conditions; the inertia images at sections of the boundary specialize compatibly. The extension (1.11.5) covers finite-type families after stratification and dévissage, with the model and the locally constant image conditions kept explicit.

### 5.16. The abstract Hadamard–de la Vallée-Poussin theorem

Let G be a locally compact extension of Γ=ℤ or ℝ by a compact group G⁰; in the ℤ case the center maps onto a finite-index subgroup of Γ, and in the ℝ case the extension is a product. Fix the norm character ω₁, a countable family of conjugacy classes with norms N_v>1, and absolute convergence of the trivial Euler product for real part >1. Regard L as a function on the representation Riemann surfaces r=ρ⊗ω_s. If it continues meromorphically to real part ≥1 and is holomorphic there except a simple pole at r=ω₁, then it has no zeros on real part 1 except possibly at one representation r=ω₁ε with ε a one-dimensional order-two character. The curve application excludes this exception by the connected double-cover zeta comparison. The norm-character translation is part of the statement, so imaginary twists are not incorrectly assigned separate pole conditions.

### 5.17. The compact form of Weil monodromy

Let X₀ be a normal geometrically connected scheme over 𝔽_q and G an algebraic-by-ℤ group satisfying Weil II (2.2.4): (a) its algebraic degree-zero kernel G⁰ is an extension of a finite group by a semisimple group; (b) a finite coefficient field E/ℚ_ℓ models G⁰ and the geometric Weil-group homomorphism is continuous and Zariski dense; (c) an algebraic representation gives an ι-mixed Weil sheaf and its restriction to G⁰ has finite kernel. Fix ι. Write Z_c for the center and choose a maximal compact subgroup U of the complex algebraic quotient G/Z_c. Define G_R as its inverse image in G_ℂ, with discrete degree; its degree-zero kernel is compact. Every local ιF_x has semisimple part conjugate to an element of G_R, uniquely up to G_R conjugacy. Restriction gives an equivalence between algebraic finite-dimensional representations of G and continuous finite-dimensional complex representations of G_R. For an irreducible representation r, use the source’s convention ω₁(g)=q^(−deg g) and |r(z)|=ω₁(z)^Re(r) for positive-degree central z. Its associated sheaf is ι-pure of weight −2Re(r), correcting the printed sign in (2.2.8)(i) and (3.5.1). Thus the scalar q^(τ deg) has Re(r)=−τ and weight 2τ.

API:

- `compactWeilForm`: The inverse image of the chosen maximal compact subgroup of the quotient by the central scalars.

- `compactWeilForm.geometricKernel`: The compact degree-zero subgroup and its normalized Haar probability.

- `compactWeilForm.degree`: The geometric-degree map to ℤ with central weight action retained.

- `compactWeilForm.frobeniusClass`: The compact conjugacy class of the semisimple Frobenius part in its degree fibre.

- `compactWeilForm.conjugacy_iff`: Two elements of G_R conjugate in G_ℂ are conjugate in G_R.

- `compactWeilForm.representationEquivalence`: Algebraic representations of G correspond to continuous finite-dimensional representations of G_R, respecting tensor and dual operations.

- `compactWeilForm.normExponent_weight`: With ω₁=q^(−deg) as in (2.1.1), an irreducible norm exponent Re(r) gives sheaf weight −2Re(r). In particular ω₁ is the Tate line of weight −2.

Tests:

- `compact_constant_weight`: For a constant pure line of weight β, degree n acts by q^(nβ/2) times a unit complex scalar; the degree-zero kernel is trivial.

- `compact_elliptic`: For full SL₂ geometric monodromy of H¹ of a nonisotrivial elliptic family, G_R is SU(2)×ℤ and (g,n) acts by q^(n/2)g.

- `compact_jordan_part`: A unipotent Jordan arithmetic Frobenius of weight zero contributes its semisimple class 1; its unipotent part is not declared unitary.

- `compact_normCharacter_sign`: The norm character ω₁=q^(−deg) has Re(ω₁)=1 but the associated Tate line has weight −2, excluding the printed +2Re formula.

### 5.18. The strict initial H¹ bound

For a smooth curve U₀/𝔽_q and a lisse sheaf punctually ι-pure of real weight β, every eigenvalue on H¹_c(U,ℱ) has ι-weight strictly less than β+2. This bound does not assert β+1; it is the analytic input to the square-improvement argument.

### 5.19. Character decay and degree-fibre equidistribution

In the abstract compact-by-ℤ setting, add hypotheses (C) of (2.1.10): all irreducible Euler products are nonvanishing and holomorphic on Re(s)≥1 except the simple trivial norm-character pole; and (D): norms are powers of q. Fix a positive-degree central element z of degree d. The translated, normalized prime-power Dirac measures on degree nd+i conjugacy fibres converge weakly to the pushforward of normalized Haar on the corresponding degree-i fibre. The measures count powers with their degree weights; replacing them with rational-point Frobenius classes requires the actual identity (3.5.2.1).

## DWP.6 — Sharp curve purity by square improvement

The external square on C × C, with coefficient-specific vanishing cycles and a pencil, improves a coarse error δ to δ/2. Iterate, then use curve duality. Finite-cover reduction and trace splitting preserve the original coefficient object; the proof must not replace it by an unrelated unipotent system.

### 6.1. Vanishing cycles with unipotent boundary coefficients

Let S₀ be a smooth projective surface, D₀ a strict normal-crossings divisor, V₀=S₀−D₀, and ℱ₀ a lisse sheaf on V₀ with unipotent local monodromy along D₀. Choose a pencil satisfying Weil II (3.1.1)(A)–(D), with each exceptional fibre having just one of the three indicated singularities. For j_!ℱ on the blown-up pencil, Φ^a vanishes for a≠1. At an ordinary node outside D, Φ¹=ℱ_x(−1)⊗ε(B), where ε(B) is the sign line on the two branches. At a tangency with D, or a transverse intersection of two branches of D, a locally constant graded boundary filtration gives Gr Φ¹=Gr ℱ_x⊗ε(B), with no Tate twist in these two cases.

### 6.2. Reality of curve cohomological factors

If U₀ is a smooth finite-field curve and ℱ₀ is lisse, punctually ι-pure of real weight β and ι-real, then each polynomial ι det(1−tF,Hⁱ_c(U,ℱ)) has real coefficients. Geometric connectedness is unnecessary after component and finite-extension descent.

### 6.3. Square improvement on the product of a curve

For a smooth finite-field curve U₀ and lisse punctually ι-pure weight-zero ℱ₀, every eigenvalue α of H¹_c(U,ℱ) satisfies w_ι(α)≤1+2^(−k), for every integer k≥0. The step k→k+1 is proved on a pencil in the compactified surface U₀×U₀ and uses the three coefficient-specific vanishing-cycle cases; it is not a direct application of the general direct-image theorem.

### 6.4. Purity of parabolic curve cohomology

Let C₀ be a smooth projective finite-field curve, j:U₀→C₀ a dense open, and ℱ₀ lisse and punctually ι-pure of real weight β. For i=0,1,2, every eigenvalue on Hⁱ(C,j_*ℱ) has ι-weight exactly β+i. In degree one this group is the image of H¹_c(U,ℱ)→H¹(U,ℱ). If ℱ is integer-pure for every embedding, the eigenvalues are algebraic Weil q-numbers of weight β+i.

### 6.5. Compact-support bounds for pure curve coefficients

For a smooth finite-field curve U₀ and lisse punctually ι-pure real-weight-β ℱ₀, Hⁱ_c(U,ℱ) has only ι-weights ≤β+i, for i=0,1,2. For integer purity, these are algebraic integer-weight bounds for every complex conjugate. The parabolic image in degree one is pure β+1, while the extra boundary contribution has weights ≤β.

## DWP.7 — General direct images, integrality and valuation bounds

Reduce general compact-support direct images to a tame relative curve, retaining both source and target dévissage steps. Apply DWP.6 on closed fibres and the local boundary bounds. Integrality is a separate theorem; combine it with archimedean purity and duality to obtain the lower weights and valuation triangles.

Geometric schemes here are separated and noetherian, with ℓ invertible. The finite-type base and the additional smoothness, normality or properness assumptions are those specified in each item.

### 7.1. Weil II §1.2 weight conventions for DWP.7–DWP.9, imported from DWP.5

Use DWP.5’s predicates on separated schemes of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ], with constructible ℚ̄_ℓ coefficients and, over finite fields, Weil descent. At a closed point x use its geometric Frobenius and N(x). Integer purity means all eigenvalues are Weil N(x)-numbers of one integer weight; fixed-ι purity uses one real modulus weight. Mixedness is a finite subsheaf filtration with pure quotients, with actual weights from nonzero pieces. Subquotients, extensions, arbitrary pullback and finite direct image preserve mixedness; pure tensor weights add, lisse dual weights negate and Tate twist r subtracts 2r. Fibre restriction uses the same closed-point residue fields. Integer mixedness implies ι-mixedness for every ι. This item applies the common definitions without constructing a second set of predicates.

Inputs: [5.3](#target-5-3), [5.2](#target-5-2), [0.15](#target-0-15), [0.1](#target-0-1), [0.4](#target-0-4), [0.6](#target-0-6), [E12](#input-e12).

### 7.2. Integral sheaves

Let X be a scheme of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ]. A sheaf ℱ on X is integral (entier) when, for every closed point x ∈ |X|, every eigenvalue of the geometric Frobenius F_x on the stalk ℱ_x̄ is integral over ℤ. For a finite-dimensional ℚ̄_ℓ-space V with an endomorphism F the analogous predicate is: (V, F) is integral when every root of det(T − F) in ℚ̄_ℓ is integral over ℤ; a sheaf on Spec 𝔽_q is integral exactly when its geometric-Frobenius module is. Integrality is a condition separate from purity: ℚ̄_ℓ(1) is pure of weight −2 and not integral.

Scope: Integrality is over ℤ. It is stronger than the automatic ℤ_ℓ-integrality of an étale stalk eigenvalue.

API:

- `IsIntegralEnd`: IsIntegralEnd (F : V →ₗ[E] V) : Prop := ∀ α ∈ eigenvalues F, IsIntegral ℤ α, for E a field of characteristic 0 and V finite-dimensional, with eigenvalues F the DWP.0 multiset of roots of the characteristic polynomial in an algebraic closure.

- `IsIntegralSheaf`: IsIntegralSheaf ℱ : Prop := ∀ x ∈ |X|, IsIntegralEnd (F_x acting on ℱ_x̄).

- `isIntegralEnd_iff_charpoly`: IsIntegralEnd F ↔ every root of det(T − F) in an algebraic closure is integral over ℤ; when det(T − F) has rational coefficients this holds iff it has integer coefficients.

- `IsIntegralEnd.of_extension`: For an F-stable subspace W ⊆ V: IsIntegralEnd F ↔ IsIntegralEnd (F|W) ∧ IsIntegralEnd (F on V/W).

- `IsIntegralEnd.pow`: IsIntegralEnd F → IsIntegralEnd (F ^ r) for r ≥ 1, and conversely: an algebraic number with an integral power is integral.

- `IsIntegralEnd.tensor`: IsIntegralEnd F → IsIntegralEnd G → IsIntegralEnd (F ⊗ G).

- `IsIntegralSheaf.comap`: Pullback along any morphism of schemes of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ] preserves integrality.

- `IsIntegralSheaf.finite_pushforward`: Direct image along a finite morphism preserves integrality.

- `IsIntegralSheaf.twist_neg`: ℱ integral and m ≥ 0 ⇒ ℱ(−m) integral; the converse fails for m > 0.

- `IsIntegralSheaf.weights_nonneg`: An integral mixed sheaf has all punctual weights ≥ 0 (Weil II 3.3.2): the norm of an integral Weil q-number of weight n and degree d is a nonzero integer of absolute value q^{nd/2} (DWP.0/weil-number-arithmetic (iv)).

- `IsIntegralSheaf.constant`: The constant sheaf ℚ̄_ℓ is integral; so is every sheaf ℱ whose Frobenius traces at all closed points of all finite extensions are algebraic integers.

Tests:

- `isIntegralEnd_tate_neg_one`: On Spec 𝔽_q, ℚ̄_ℓ(−1) (F acts by q) is integral: q is an algebraic integer.

- `not_isIntegralEnd_tate_one`: On Spec 𝔽_q, ℚ̄_ℓ(1) (F acts by q⁻¹) is not integral although it is punctually pure of weight −2: purity does not imply integrality.

- `not_isIntegralEnd_weight_zero`: For ℓ ≠ 5, the rank-one Weil sheaf on Spec 𝔽_q on which F acts by b = (3 + 4i)/5 is punctually pure of weight 0 (every complex conjugate of b has absolute value 1) but not integral: b is not an algebraic integer. A definition 'integral = weights ≥ 0' fails this test.

- `isIntegralEnd_zero`: The zero sheaf, and the zero Frobenius module, are integral.

- `isIntegralEnd_jordan`: The Frobenius module (ℚ̄_ℓ², [[q, 1], [0, q]]) is integral: integrality reads the characteristic polynomial (T − q)², not a diagonal form.

### 7.3. Dévissages (a), (b), (f) of the direct-image theorem

Let f : X → Y be a separated morphism of schemes of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ] and n ∈ ℤ. Say that a sheaf ℱ on X satisfies P_n(f) when R^i f_!ℱ is mixed of weights ≤ n + i for every i. (a) For an exact sequence 0 → ℱ′ → ℱ → ℱ″ → 0: P_n(f) for ℱ′ and ℱ″ implies P_n(f) for ℱ; P_n(f) for ℱ and ℱ″ implies P_n(f) for ℱ′; if the sequence splits, P_n(f) for ℱ implies P_n(f) for ℱ′. (b) If j : U → X is open with closed complement i : S → X, then P_n(f∘j) for j*ℱ and P_n(f∘i) for i*ℱ imply P_n(f) for ℱ. (f) If f is quasi-finite and ℱ is punctually pure of weight m, then f_!ℱ = R⁰f_!ℱ is punctually pure of weight m and R^i f_!ℱ = 0 for i ≠ 0; hence, by (a), every mixed ℱ of weights ≤ n satisfies P_n(f) when f is quasi-finite. The same statements hold with 'mixed of weights ≤ n + i' replaced by 'ι-mixed of ι-weights ≤ β + i' (β ∈ ℝ) and, for X over 𝔽_q, for Weil sheaves.

### 7.4. Dévissages (c), (d), (e) of the direct-image theorem

Keep the notation P_n(f) of DWP.7/devissage-in-the-sheaf-and-the-source. (c) Let j : V → Y be open with closed complement i : T → Y, and f_V, f_T the base changes of f. Then ℱ satisfies P_n(f) iff ℱ|X_V satisfies P_n(f_V) and ℱ|X_T satisfies P_n(f_T). More generally, a sheaf 𝒢 on Y is mixed of weights ≤ m iff 𝒢|V and 𝒢|T are. (d) If f = g ∘ h with h : X → Z and g : Z → Y separated of finite type, and R^p g_! R^q h_!ℱ is mixed of weights ≤ n + p + q for all p, q, then ℱ satisfies P_n(f); in particular P_n(h) for ℱ together with P_{n+q}(g) for every R^q h_!ℱ implies P_n(f). (e) If g : Y′ → Y is a universal homeomorphism (integral, radicial, surjective), f′ : X′ → Y′ the base change and ℱ′ the pullback of ℱ, then ℱ satisfies P_n(f) iff ℱ′ satisfies P_n(f′); examples: Y′ = Y_red, and for Y normal integral, the normalisation of Y in a purely inseparable extension of its function field. The same statements hold for ι-mixed sheaves with real weights.

### 7.5. Generic smoothness and tame covers of a lisse sheaf on a curve (Weil II (α), (β))

Let K be a field in which ℓ is invertible, C a separated K-scheme of finite type of dimension 1, and ℱ a lisse ℚ̄_ℓ-sheaf on C. After replacing K by a finite purely inseparable extension (none is needed if K is perfect): (α) there is a finite set Σ of closed points of C_red such that C′ = C_red − Σ is smooth over K; (β) there are a smooth projective curve D̄ over K, a reduced divisor E ⊂ D̄ étale over K, and a finite étale surjective morphism u : D = D̄ − E → C′ such that u*ℱ is tamely ramified along E, and ℱ|C′ is a direct summand of u_*u*ℱ = Ru_*u*ℱ.

Scope: Trace followed by adjunction multiplies by the cover degree on each component, which is invertible in ℚ̄_ℓ.

### 7.6. Reduction of the direct-image theorem to a tame smooth projective relative curve

Assume Theorem 3.3.1 holds for every quadruple (f̄, D, ℱ, Y) of the following kind: Y is an integral regular scheme of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ] (the source's 'Y_red lisse'); f̄ : X̄ → Y is projective and smooth of pure relative dimension 1; D ⊂ X̄ is a divisor finite étale over Y; X = X̄ − D with f = f̄|X; and ℱ is a lisse sheaf on X, punctually pure of weight n and tamely ramified along D. Then Theorem 3.3.1 holds for every separated morphism of schemes of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ] and every sheaf mixed of weights ≤ n. The same reduction holds for ι-mixed sheaves with real weights.

More precisely Rf_!ℱ = Rf̄_*(j_!ℱ); R^i f̄_*(j_*ℱ) is punctually pure of weight n + i; and i*j_*ℱ carries the filtration induced by the local monodromy filtration M along D, with Gr^M_k(i*j_*ℱ) zero for k > 0 and punctually pure of weight n + k on D for k ≤ 0.

Let f : X → Y be a separated morphism of schemes of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ] and ℱ a sheaf on X, mixed of weights ≤ n. Then for every i the sheaf R^i f_!ℱ on Y is mixed of weights ≤ n + i. In particular, for X₀ of finite type over 𝔽_q, Y₀ = Spec 𝔽_q and ℱ₀ mixed of weights ≤ n (a Weil sheaf being allowed), every eigenvalue α of the geometric Frobenius F on H^i_c(X, ℱ) is an algebraic number for which there is an integer w ≤ n + i with |σ(α)| = q^{w/2} for every field embedding σ : ℚ(α) → ℂ.

### 7.9. The direct-image theorem for ι-mixed sheaves with real weights

Fix a field isomorphism ι : ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℂ and β ∈ ℝ. Let f : X → Y be a separated morphism of schemes of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ] and ℱ an ι-mixed sheaf on X with punctual ι-weights ≤ β. Then for every i, R^i f_!ℱ is ι-mixed, and every punctual ι-weight of R^i f_!ℱ is ≤ β + i and congruent modulo ℤ to one of the punctual ι-weights of ℱ. Over 𝔽_q (Weil sheaves allowed), every eigenvalue of F on H^i_c(X, ℱ) has ι-weight ≤ β + i in such a class. No algebraicity, no integrality and no bound at another embedding follows from this statement.

Let X₀ be a scheme of finite type over 𝔽_q, X = X₀ ⊗ 𝔽̄_q. (i) (Weil II 3.3.4) If ℱ₀ is mixed of weights ≤ n (a Weil sheaf being allowed), then H^i_c(X, ℱ) is mixed of weights ≤ n + i: every eigenvalue α of F is algebraic, with an integer w ≤ n + i such that every complex conjugate of α has absolute value q^{w/2}. If ℱ₀ is integral then w ≥ 0, and if moreover i > d = dim X₀ then w ≥ 2(i − d). (ii) (3.3.5) If X₀ is smooth and ℱ₀ is lisse and mixed of weights ≥ n, then H^i(X, ℱ) is mixed of weights ≥ n + i. (iii) (3.3.6) If X₀ is smooth and ℱ₀ is lisse and punctually pure of weight n, then the image of H^i_c(X, ℱ) → H^i(X, ℱ) is pure of weight n + i.

### 7.13. The p-adic couple of a pure algebraic number

Let q = p^f, n ∈ ℤ, and α an algebraic number which is a Weil q-number of weight n (DWP.0). Let K be a number field containing α and v a valuation of K above p, normalised by v(q) = 1, extended to v : K → ℚ ∪ {∞}. The couple of α at v is (r, s) = (v(α), v(q^n α⁻¹)). Here q^n α⁻¹ ∈ K, and under every embedding σ : K → ℂ it maps to the complex conjugate of σ(α) (DWP.0/weil-number-arithmetic (iii)); so q^n α⁻¹ has the same minimal polynomial over ℚ as α, i.e. it is a Galois conjugate of α. Always r + s = n; if α is integral over ℤ then r ≥ 0 and s ≥ 0.

API:

- `newtonCouple`: newtonCouple (v : AddValuation K (WithTop ℚ)) (q : K) (n : ℤ) (α : K) : WithTop ℚ × WithTop ℚ := (v α, v (q ^ n * α⁻¹)).

- `newtonCouple_fst_add_snd`: v q = 1 → α ≠ 0 → (newtonCouple v q n α).1 + (newtonCouple v q n α).2 = n.

- `newtonCouple_nonneg`: If α and q^n α⁻¹ are integral over ℤ (in particular if α is integral and a Weil q-number of weight n) and v is nonnegative on the integers of K, both coordinates are ≥ 0.

- `newtonCouple_swap_conj`: For a Weil q-number α of weight n, the couple of q^n α⁻¹ is the couple of α with its coordinates swapped.

- `newtonCouple_galois`: For τ ∈ Aut(K) fixing q, newtonCouple (v ∘ τ) q n α = newtonCouple v q n (τ α). In the intended number-field application q is rational, so it is fixed.

- `newtonCouple_mul`: For q ≠ 0, newtonCouple v q (n + m) (αβ) = newtonCouple v q n α + newtonCouple v q m β. The raw valuation API needs q ≠ 0 to use integer-power multiplication; it follows from v(q)=1 in the intended normalisation.

- `newtonCouple_div_pow`: The couple of α/q^m (weight n − 2m) is (r − m, s − m).

Tests:

- `newtonCouple_fst_add_snd`: r + s = n for every valuation v with v(q) = 1 and every nonzero α.

- `newtonCouple_supersingular`: q = p, α = √−p (weight 1, a root of T² + p): at the unique place above p of ℚ(√−p), (r, s) = (1/2, 1/2).

- `newtonCouple_ordinary`: q = 5, α = 1 + 2i (weight 1, |α|² = 5): at the place v of ℚ(i) with v(1 + 2i) = 1 (normalised v(5) = 1), (r, s) = (1, 0); at the conjugate place (r, s) = (0, 1).

- `newtonCouple_tate`: α = q^m (weight 2m): (r, s) = (m, m) at every place above p.

- `newtonCouple_nonintegral`: α = q⁻¹ (weight −2): (r, s) = (−1, −1); the nonnegativity of r and s genuinely needs integrality.

- `newtonCouple_zero_base`: In the raw valuation definition, with q=0, α=β=1, n=1 and m=−1, the couple at n+m=0 is (0,0), while the sum of the two couples is (0,∞). Thus the multiplication API requires q ≠ 0.

### 7.14. The p-adic couples of Frobenius eigenvalues lie in triangles

Let X₀ be a scheme of finite type over 𝔽_q, q = p^f, of dimension ≤ d, and i ≥ 0. Let α be an eigenvalue of F on H^i_c(X, ℚ̄_ℓ), or on H^i(X, ℚ̄_ℓ) when X₀ is proper, of weight w, and (r, s) its couple at a place v above p (DWP.7/newton-couples-3-3-7). Then r + s = w ≤ i and r, s ≥ max(0, i − d): (r, s) lies in the lower triangle {r + s ≤ i, r ≥ max(0, i − d), s ≥ max(0, i − d)}. If X₀ is smooth of dimension ≤ d and α is an eigenvalue of F on H^i(X, ℚ̄_ℓ), then r + s = w ≥ i and r, s ≤ min(i, d): (r, s) lies in the upper triangle {r + s ≥ i, r ≤ min(i, d), s ≤ min(i, d)}.

Scope: Use constant coefficients; the upper-triangle duality argument is degreewise on smooth pure-dimensional components.

### 7.15. Purity for proper smooth varieties and rational homology manifolds over a finite field

Let X₀ be a scheme of finite type over 𝔽_q, X = X₀ ⊗ 𝔽̄_q, a : X₀ → Spec 𝔽_q. (i) If X₀ is proper and smooth and ℱ₀ is lisse and punctually pure of weight n, then H^i(X, ℱ) is pure of weight n + i for every i; the same holds for ι-purity with n ∈ ℝ. (ii) (Weil II 3.3.9) If X₀ is proper and smooth, then for every i the polynomial det(1 − F t, H^i(X, ℚ_ℓ)) has integer coefficients independent of ℓ ≠ p, and its reciprocal roots, the eigenvalues of F, are Weil q-numbers of weight i. (iii) (3.3.11) In (i) and (ii) and in DWP.7/cohomological-bounds-3-3-2-3-3-6 (ii)–(iii), 'smooth of pure dimension N' may be replaced by the condition that X₀ is of pure dimension N and Ra^!ℚ_ℓ ≅ ℚ_ℓ(N)[2N] Frobenius-equivariantly (EDC.1's exceptional inverse image), for instance when X₀ is étale-locally the quotient of a smooth scheme of dimension N by a finite group; then the lower bound and purity statements hold with ℱ₀ = ℚ̄_ℓ.

Scope: The integral factors and ℓ-independence in (ii) use WC.3. In (iii) use constant coefficients and the displayed dualizing-object isomorphism.

## DWP.8 — Mixed complexes, weight filtrations and geometric semisimplicity

The constructible derived category and its six operations are imported; this layer proves mixedness and directional weight estimates on them. On normal bases, Ext¹ bounds give weight-class decomposition, the unique strict lisse weight filtration and geometric semisimplicity. Keep arithmetic model witnesses in potentially pure statements.

Geometric schemes here are separated and noetherian, with ℓ invertible. The finite-type base and the additional smoothness, normality or properness assumptions are those specified in each item.

### 8.1. Mixed complexes and complexes of weights ≤ w

In the imported bounded constructible derived category, define a mixed complex K by mixedness of every ℋⁱK. Define K≤w by requiring ℋⁱK to have punctual weights ≤w+i. The full mixed subcategory is triangulated. Define the fixed-ι version with real w in the same way. Use Weil coefficients over 𝔽_q and constructible coefficients over ℤ[1/ℓ].

Tests:

### 8.2. Complexes of weights ≥ w and pure complexes

Let X₀ be of finite type over 𝔽_q, a : X₀ → Spec 𝔽_q, K_{X₀} = Ra^!ℚ̄_ℓ the dualizing complex and D = RHom(−, K_{X₀}) the duality functor of EDC.1, which is involutive on D^b_c(X₀), exchanges f* with Rf^! and Rf_* with Rf_!, and satisfies D(K ⊗ L) = RHom(K, DL). A complex K is mixed of weights ≥ w when DK is mixed of weights ≤ −w (DWP.8/mixed-complexes). K is pure of weight w when it is mixed of weights ≤ w and of weights ≥ w (Weil II 6.2.4). A sheaf ℱ is pure of weight w when the complex ℱ[0] is. The ι-variants (w ∈ ℝ) are defined in the same way. On X₀ smooth of pure dimension d, K_{X₀} = ℚ̄_ℓ(d)[2d] (EDC.2), so K has weights ≥ w iff RHom(K, ℚ̄_ℓ) has weights ≤ −w.

### 8.6. Mixed sheaves on the special fibre with an action of the generic Galois group

Let S be a smooth finite-field curve, or a spread model in WII 6.1.1(b), and let X be of finite type over its henselian trait at s. A Galois sheaf on X_s̄ has continuous Gal(η̄/η) action over the residue action. For unramified action, mixedness means mixedness of the descended sheaf on X_s. For unipotent inertia, test the unramified graded pieces of a finite Galois subsheaf filtration. For quasi-unipotent inertia, first take a finite trait extension. Prove independence of the filtration and extension, with the stability operations below. The equal-characteristic trait scope and the stated spread-model context are retained.

API:

- `IsMixedGalois`: IsMixedGalois (𝒢, ρ) : Prop, defined by (a)–(c).

- `isMixedGalois_changeOfTrait`: Invariant under finite extension of the trait.

- `IsMixedGalois.subquotient`: Stable under Galois subsheaves, quotients and extensions.

- `IsMixedGalois.tensor`: Stable under tensor products.

- `IsMixedGalois.invariants`: If (𝒢, ρ) is mixed then so is its subsheaf of I-invariants, a sheaf on X_s.

Tests:

- `isMixedGalois_trivial`: For X = S and 𝒢 = ℚ̄_ℓ with trivial inertia action, (𝒢, ρ) is mixed of weight 0 (case (a)).

- `isMixedGalois_tate_curve`: For the Tate elliptic curve over 𝔽_q((t)) (split multiplicative reduction), H¹(E_η̄, ℚ̄_ℓ) with its unipotent inertia action has the filtration ℚ̄_ℓ ⊂ H¹ with graded pieces ℚ̄_ℓ (weight 0) and ℚ̄_ℓ(−1) (weight 2): mixed, case (b).

- `isMixedGalois_quadratic_twist`: A quadratic character of I (tamely ramified, p ≠ 2) becomes trivial after a degree-2 extension of the trait: case (c) applies.

### 8.9. Purity on a smooth scheme is pointwise purity of lisse cohomology sheaves

Let X₀ be of finite type over 𝔽_q. (a) For every N ∈ ℤ, K is mixed of weights ≤ w iff K(N)[2N] is; hence in the definition of purity the dualizing complex may be replaced by any complex locally isomorphic to K_{X₀}(N)[2N]. (b) If X₀ is smooth, K has weights ≥ w iff RHom(K, ℚ̄_ℓ) has weights ≤ −w. If moreover every ℋ^iK is lisse, K is pure of weight w iff every ℋ^iK is punctually pure of weight w + i. (c) Consequently, for X₀ smooth and ℱ₀ lisse and punctually pure of weight w, the complex ℱ₀[m](r) is pure of weight w + m − 2r. The ι-variants hold.

### 8.10. j_* of a pure lisse sheaf across a smooth divisor is pure

(c) Let X₀ be a smooth curve over 𝔽_q, j : U₀ → X₀ a dense open and ℱ₀ a lisse sheaf on U₀, punctually pure of weight w (equivalently, by DWP.8/twist-shift-and-smooth-lisse-purity-6-2-5, ℱ₀ is pure of weight w as a sheaf). Then j_*ℱ₀ is pure of weight w. (d) Let X₀ be smooth, D₀ ⊂ X₀ a smooth divisor, j : U₀ = X₀ − D₀ → X₀, and ℱ₀ lisse on U₀, punctually pure of weight w and tamely ramified along D₀. Then j_*ℱ₀ is pure of weight w. The ι-variants hold.

### 8.11. Weight estimates for the six operations

Let f : X₀ → Y₀ be a morphism of schemes of finite type over 𝔽_q, and a, b, w ∈ ℤ. (i) f* and Rf_! carry complexes of weights ≤ w to complexes of weights ≤ w. (ii) Rf_* and Rf^! carry complexes of weights ≥ w to complexes of weights ≥ w. (iii) D exchanges 'weights ≤ w' and 'weights ≥ −w'. (iv) If K has weights ≤ a and L has weights ≤ b, then K ⊗ L has weights ≤ a + b. (v) If K has weights ≤ a and L has weights ≥ b, then RHom(K, L) has weights ≥ b − a. The ι-variants hold with real weights. No other preservation is asserted: Rf_* and Rf^! need not preserve upper bounds, f* and Rf_! need not preserve lower bounds, and a pure complex need not split into its cohomology sheaves.

Scope: Require separated finite-type f for the compact-support operations. Each functor has the displayed direction of bound.

### 8.12. Proper direct images of pure complexes are pure

Let f : X₀ → Y₀ be a proper morphism of schemes of finite type over 𝔽_q and K ∈ D^b_c(X₀) pure of weight w. Then Rf_*K is pure of weight w. In particular, for X₀ proper over 𝔽_q and K pure of weight w, H^i(X, K) is pure of weight w + i for every i. The ι-variant holds.

### 8.13. Pure complexes over ℤ[1/ℓ]

For X of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ] with structure map a : X → Spec ℤ[1/ℓ], put K′_X = Ra^!ℚ̄_ℓ and D′ = RHom(−, K′_X). Call K ∈ D^b_c(X) pure of weight w when K is mixed of weights ≤ w (DWP.8/mixed-complexes, read on schemes of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ]) and D′K is mixed of weights ≤ −w. If X is of finite type over 𝔽_p then K′_X = K_X(−1)[−2], so D′ = D(−1)[−2] and this notion agrees with that of DWP.8/pure-complexes. Proper direct images preserve this purity: for f : X → Y proper over ℤ[1/ℓ] and K pure of weight w, Rf_*K is pure of weight w.

### 8.14. Geometric monodromy and geometrically semisimple lisse sheaves

For a normal connected finite-field scheme, a lisse finite-model Weil sheaf gives a representation ρ on its stalk V. Define geometric monodromy as the image of the geometric fundamental group and geometric semisimplicity as semisimplicity of the restricted representation, using Representation.asModule and IsSemisimpleModule. Arithmetic semisimplicity uses the full Weil representation. For schemes not geometrically connected work on each geometric component. Prove base-point conjugacy, dense-open and finite-base-extension invariance, subquotient/dual stability, and the characteristic-zero reductive-closure criterion specified in the API.

API:

- `IsGeometricallySemisimple`: For ρ : Representation E W V and a subgroup G ≤ W: IsGeometricallySemisimple ρ G : Prop := IsSemisimpleModule (MonoidAlgebra E G) (ρ.comp G.subtype).asModule; for a lisse sheaf, W = W(X₀, x̄) and G = π₁(X, x̄).

- `geometricMonodromyGroup`: The image ρ(π₁(X, x̄)) ⊂ GL(V).

- `IsGeometricallySemisimple.of_isSemisimple`: For a finite-dimensional representation ρ over a field and G normal in W: ρ semisimple ⇒ ρ|G semisimple, by the pinned Tau Ceti Clifford theorem on each irreducible summand.

- `isGeometricallySemisimple_iff_restrict_open`: For X₀ normal and U₀ ⊂ X₀ a dense open: ℱ₀ is geometrically semisimple iff ℱ₀|U₀ is (π₁(U) → π₁(X) is surjective, IG.0).

- `isGeometricallySemisimple_baseExtension`: Unchanged by the base extension 𝔽_q → 𝔽_{q^r} (same geometric fundamental group).

- `IsGeometricallySemisimple.subquotient`: Lisse subsheaves, quotients and direct summands of a geometrically semisimple sheaf are geometrically semisimple; finite direct sums of geometrically semisimple sheaves are.

- `IsGeometricallySemisimple.dual`: The dual of a geometrically semisimple lisse sheaf is geometrically semisimple.

- `maximalGeometricallySemisimpleSubsheaf`: The largest geometrically semisimple lisse subsheaf (sum of the irreducible lisse subsheaves of ℱ), stable under Frobenius and hence defined over X₀.

- `isGeometricallySemisimple_iff_reductive`: With algebraically closed characteristic-zero coefficients and finite-dimensional stalk: ℱ₀ is geometrically semisimple iff the identity component of the Zariski closure of its geometric monodromy group is reductive (tauceti ReductiveGroups layer 6). The closure acts faithfully; invariant subspaces are unchanged by Zariski closure.

- `mem_geometricMonodromyGroup`: A linear automorphism a belongs to geometricMonodromyGroup ρ G iff a = ρ g for some g ∈ G. When stored as an endomorphism submonoid, every element is invertible since G is a group.

- `geometricMonodromyGroup_conjugate`: An isomorphism of stalk representations conjugates the geometric monodromy image; changing the geometric base point gives this conjugacy, so geometric semisimplicity is independent of the base point.

Tests:

- `isGeometricallySemisimple_jordan`: On Spec 𝔽_q the rank-two Weil sheaf on which F acts by [[1, 1], [0, 1]] is geometrically semisimple (the geometric group is trivial) but not arithmetically semisimple: purity of weight 0 does not give semisimple Frobenius.

- `not_isGeometricallySemisimple_kummer`: On 𝔾_m over 𝔽_q, the Kummer extension 0 → ℚ̄_ℓ(1) → ℒ → ℚ̄_ℓ → 0 classified by the Kummer class of the coordinate in H¹(𝔾_m, ℚ̄_ℓ(1)) is not geometrically semisimple: its geometric class in H¹(𝔾_{m,𝔽̄_q}, ℚ̄_ℓ(1)) ≅ ℚ̄_ℓ is nonzero.

- `isGeometricallySemisimple_point`: Every lisse sheaf on Spec 𝔽_q is geometrically semisimple; so is the zero sheaf on any X₀.

- `isGeometricallySemisimple_of_semisimple`: For a representation ρ of a group W and a normal subgroup G, if ρ is semisimple then ρ|G is semisimple (Clifford), so arithmetic semisimplicity implies geometric semisimplicity.

### 8.15. The Ext¹ sequence of lisse sheaves over a finite field

Let X₀ be of finite type over 𝔽_q and ℱ₀, 𝒢₀ lisse sheaves on X₀ (Weil sheaves allowed). (i) There is an exact sequence 0 → H⁰(X, ℋom(ℱ, 𝒢))_F → Ext¹(ℱ₀, 𝒢₀) → H¹(X, ℋom(ℱ, 𝒢))^F, where Ext¹ is the group of extension classes in the abelian category of sheaves on X₀, the right arrow is pullback to X followed by Ext¹(ℱ, 𝒢) = H¹(X, ℋom(ℱ, 𝒢)), and the subscript (resp. superscript) F denotes coinvariants (resp. invariants) of the Weil group W(𝔽̄_q/𝔽_q) = F^ℤ. (ii) For X₀ normal and geometrically connected this is the five-term sequence of Hochschild–Serre for 1 → π₁(X, x̄) → W(X₀, x̄) → ℤ → 1 with coefficients M = Hom(ℱ_x̄, 𝒢_x̄), using H¹(ℤ, N) = N_F and H²(ℤ, N) = 0.

Scope: Ext¹ is taken among all Weil sheaves; extensions of the two lisse sheaves are lisse.

(Lemma 3.4.3) A geometrically nontrivial extension 0 → 𝒢₀ → ℰ₀ → ℱ₀ → 0 can exist only if β ≡ γ (mod ℤ) and β > γ. (Lemma 3.4.4) Ext¹(ℱ₀, 𝒢₀) ≠ 0 only if β ≡ γ (mod ℤ) and β ≥ γ.

### 8.17. The decomposition of an ι-mixed sheaf by weights modulo ℤ

Let X₀ be of finite type over 𝔽_q, ι : ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℂ, and ℱ₀ an ι-mixed sheaf on X₀ (Weil sheaves allowed). There is a unique decomposition ℱ₀ = ⊕_{b ∈ ℝ/ℤ} ℱ₀(b), almost all summands zero, such that the punctual ι-weights of ℱ₀(b) lie in b. It is functorial: every morphism ℱ₀ → 𝒢₀ of ι-mixed sheaves maps ℱ₀(b) to 𝒢₀(b). Each ℱ₀(b) is a twist ℋ₀^{(c)} (Weil II 1.2.7) of an ι-mixed sheaf ℋ₀ with integer punctual weights, for any c ∈ ℚ̄_ℓ^× with ι-weight in b. Stalkwise, for x ∈ |X₀|: ℱ₀(b)_x̄ = ⊕_{β ∈ b} ℱ_x̄(β), where ℱ_x̄(β) is the sum of the generalised eigenspaces of F_x for the eigenvalues of ι-weight β relative to N(x).

API:

- `weightClass`: weightClass ℱ₀ (b : ℝ/ℤ) : the summand ℱ₀(b), a subsheaf of ℱ₀.

- `weightClass_isInternal`: ℱ₀ is the internal direct sum of the ℱ₀(b), with finitely many nonzero.

- `weightClass_stalk`: (ℱ₀(b))_x̄ = ⊕_{β ∈ b} ℱ_x̄(β), generalised eigenspaces of F_x.

- `weightClass_map`: φ : ℱ₀ → 𝒢₀ maps ℱ₀(b) into 𝒢₀(b); weightClass is an exact functor; map_id and map_comp hold.

- `weightClass_unique`: Any decomposition ℱ₀ = ⊕ 𝒜(b) with the weights of 𝒜(b) in b equals the weight-class decomposition.

- `weightClass_eq_twist`: ℱ₀(b) ≅ ℋ₀^{(c)} with ℋ₀ of integer ι-weights, for any c of ι-weight in b.

- `weightClass_of_integer`: If all punctual ι-weights of ℱ₀ are integers then ℱ₀(0) = ℱ₀.

- `weightClass_tensor`: (ℱ₀ ⊗ 𝒢₀)(b) = ⊕_{b′ + b″ = b} ℱ₀(b′) ⊗ 𝒢₀(b″).

Tests:

- `weightClass_fractional`: On Spec 𝔽_q with ι fixed and a chosen fourth root q^{1/4}, ℚ̄_ℓ ⊕ ℚ̄_ℓ^{(q^{1/4})} has nonzero classes exactly 0 and 1/2 mod ℤ.

- `weightClass_integral`: ℚ̄_ℓ ⊕ ℚ̄_ℓ(1) on Spec 𝔽_q has all of its weight in the class 0: the decomposition is by weight modulo ℤ, not by weight.

- `weightClass_depends_on_iota`: For b = 1 + √2 (an ℓ-adic unit, of norm −1), ℚ̄_ℓ^{(b)} on Spec 𝔽_q has ι-weight 2 log_q(1 + √2) or −2 log_q(1 + √2) according to ι(√2) = ±√2: the class depends on ι.

- `weightClass_zero`: The zero sheaf has all classes zero.

- `weightClass_point`: On Spec 𝔽_q, ℱ₀(b) is the sum of the generalised eigenspaces of F whose ι-weights lie in b, i.e. DWP.0's decomposition (ii) regrouped modulo ℤ.

### 8.18. The weight filtration of a lisse mixed sheaf

Let X₀ be of finite type over 𝔽_q, ι : ℚ̄_ℓ ≅ ℂ, and ℱ₀ a lisse ι-mixed sheaf on X₀ whose punctual ι-weights are integers. There is a unique finite increasing filtration W of ℱ₀ by lisse subsheaves W_iℱ₀ (the filtration by punctual weight) such that Gr^W_i ℱ₀ is punctually ι-pure of weight i for every i. It is functorial, and every morphism between lisse ι-mixed sheaves with integer punctual weights is strictly compatible with the weight filtrations. Stalkwise (W_iℱ₀)_x̄ = ⊕_{β ≤ i} ℱ_x̄(β). For a lisse mixed sheaf (integer weights at every ι) the filtration does not depend on ι (Weil II 3.4.9).

Scope: The unique strict weight filtration need not split as a lisse sheaf.

API:

- `weightFiltration`: weightFiltration ℱ₀ : ℤ → lisse subsheaves of ℱ₀, i ↦ W_iℱ₀, monotone, W_i = 0 for i ≪ 0 and = ℱ₀ for i ≫ 0.

- `weightFiltration_gr_pure`: Gr^W_i ℱ₀ is lisse and punctually ι-pure of weight i.

- `weightFiltration_unique`: Any finite increasing filtration by lisse subsheaves with Gr_i punctually ι-pure of weight i equals W.

- `weightFiltration_stalk`: (W_iℱ₀)_x̄ = ⊕_{β ≤ i} ℱ_x̄(β).

- `weightFiltration_map`: φ(W_iℱ₀) ⊆ W_i𝒢₀, with map_id and map_comp for the induced maps on Gr^W.

- `weightFiltration_strict`: φ(W_iℱ₀) = φ(ℱ₀) ∩ W_i𝒢₀; hence Gr^W is an exact functor.

- `weightFiltration_tensor`: W_k(ℱ₀ ⊗ 𝒢₀) = Σ_{i+j=k} W_iℱ₀ ⊗ W_j𝒢₀.

- `weightFiltration_dual`: W_i(ℱ₀^∨) = (ℱ₀ / W_{−i−1}ℱ₀)^∨.

- `weightFiltration_pullback`: g*W_iℱ₀ = W_i(g*ℱ₀) for g : Y₀ → X₀.

- `weightFiltration_twist`: W_i(ℱ₀(r)) = (W_{i+2r}ℱ₀)(r).

- `weightFiltration_indep_iota`: For lisse mixed ℱ₀ (integer weights for every ι), W does not depend on ι.

Tests:

- `weightFiltration_kummer`: For the Kummer extension 0 → ℚ̄_ℓ(1) → ℒ → ℚ̄_ℓ → 0 on 𝔾_m over 𝔽_q: W_{−3} = 0, W_{−2} = W_{−1} = ℚ̄_ℓ(1), W_0 = ℒ.

- `weightFiltration_pure`: For ℱ₀ punctually pure of weight n: W_{n−1} = 0 and W_n = ℱ₀.

- `weightFiltration_not_split`: The Kummer extension ℒ is not isomorphic to Gr^W ℒ = ℚ̄_ℓ(1) ⊕ ℚ̄_ℓ: the weight filtration is not a grading on the sheaf.

- `weightFiltration_point`: On Spec 𝔽_q, W_iV is the sum of the generalised eigenspaces of F of weight ≤ i; for the Jordan block [[q, 1], [0, q]], W_1 = 0 and W_2 = V.

- `weightFiltration_strict_example`: The inclusion ℚ̄_ℓ(1) → ℒ is strict: its image meets W_{−2}ℒ in the whole image, and W_{−1} of the cokernel ℚ̄_ℓ is 0.

### 8.19. Deligne's semisimplicity theorem: pure lisse sheaves are geometrically semisimple

### 8.20. Sheaves and complexes potentially having a property P

For an isomorphism-invariant property P of finite-field sheaves or complexes, potentially P on X/k requires an explicit model: integral S of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ], a point Spec k→S, finite-type X_S, a sheaf or bounded constructible complex on X_S, and an identification of its fibre with the given object. Every closed fibre over S must satisfy P. The field k is algebraically closed with ℓ invertible. For complex purity, duality is relative to the finite residue field. The API transports these witnesses and states the extra stability and common-refinement hypotheses for sums, pullbacks and field extensions.

Scope: Require P invariant under isomorphism. Finite-sum and base-extension stability are hypotheses of the corresponding operations, together with the stated witness/refinement conditions.

API:

- `ArithmeticModel`: The data (S, x̄, X_S, ℱ_S or K_S, iso) of a model of (X, ℱ) over an integral S of finite type over ℤ[1/ℓ].

- `PotentiallyHas`: PotentiallyHas P ℱ : Prop := ∃ M : ArithmeticModel X ℱ, ∀ s ∈ |M.S|, P (M.ℱ_S|X_s).

- `PotentiallyHas.mono`: (∀ ℱ, P ℱ → Q ℱ) → PotentiallyHas P ℱ → PotentiallyHas Q ℱ.

- `ArithmeticModel.restrict`: Restrict a model to a dense open of S containing the image of x̄; the fibrewise property is inherited.

- `PotentiallyHas.pullback`: If g : Y → X spreads out over a model, then g*ℱ is potentially P whenever ℱ is and P is stable under pullback.

- `PotentiallyHas.directSum`: If the supplied arithmetic witnesses admit a common refinement and P is stable under finite direct sums and finite extensions of finite ground fields, their finite direct sum is potentially P. Pull the witnesses to this common model, use finite-field-extension stability on its closed fibres, and take the direct sum there. A common refinement of arbitrary ℓ-adic sheaf models is not silently asserted.

- `potentially_baseChange_algClosed`: For an extension k ⊂ k′ of algebraically closed fields, PotentiallyHas P ℱ implies PotentiallyHas P ℱ_{k′}, using the same model and composing x̄ with Spec k′ → Spec k. The converse requires a witnessing model over k′ whose base-point map and fibre identification descend to k; no unconditional converse for arbitrary P is asserted.

- `PotentiallyHas.of_iso`: For P invariant under isomorphism, an isomorphism of (X,ℱ) with (X′,ℱ′) transports an ArithmeticModel and gives PotentiallyHas P ℱ ↔ PotentiallyHas P ℱ′.

Tests:

- `potentiallyPure_const_smooth`: For X smooth over k algebraically closed, ℚ̄_ℓ[0] is potentially pure of weight 0: spread X out to X_S smooth over S, and ℚ̄_ℓ on each smooth fibre is pure (DWP.8/twist-shift-and-smooth-lisse-purity-6-2-5).

- `potentially_of_finite_field`: Over k = 𝔽̄_q, a sheaf ℱ₀ on X₀/𝔽_q with property P is potentially P with model S = Spec 𝔽_q.

- `not_potentiallyPure_kummer`: The Kummer extension ℒ on 𝔾_m over ℂ (a nonsplit unipotent local system of rank two) is potentially mixed but not potentially punctually ι-pure: otherwise it would be semisimple by DWP.8/potentially-pure-lisse-sheaves-are-semisimple-3-4-12.

- `potentially_zero`: The zero sheaf is potentially P for every P satisfied by zero sheaves, with any model.

Let k be algebraically closed with ℓ invertible, X of finite type over k, and f : Y → X proper and smooth.

### 8.24. The weight spectral sequence of a normal crossings compactification

Let X₀ be a smooth proper scheme of pure dimension d over 𝔽_q, D₀ ⊂ X₀ a divisor with normal crossings, U₀ = X₀ − D₀ and j : U₀ → X₀. For m ≥ 1 let ν_m : D^{(m)}₀ → X₀ be the normalisation of the locus of points lying on at least m local branches of D₀ (étale locally the disjoint union of the m-fold intersections of the branches), D^{(0)}₀ = X₀, and ε_m the rank-one orientation sheaf on D^{(m)}₀, the determinant of the permutation representation on the m local branches. Then there is a spectral sequence of Frobenius modules E₁^{m,k} = H^k(D^{(m)}, ε_m) ⇒ H^{m+k}_c(U, ℚ_ℓ), whose d₁ is the alternating sum of the restriction maps; E₁^{m,k} is pure of weight k, the sequence degenerates at E₂, and E₂^{m,k} = Gr^W_k H^{m+k}_c(U, ℚ_ℓ) for the weight filtration of the Frobenius module H^{m+k}_c(U). The same holds for X₀ a smooth proper Deligne–Mumford stack over 𝔽_q with a normal crossings divisor, the D^{(m)} being smooth proper Deligne–Mumford stacks; for the boundary of M̄_{g,n} it reads E₁^{j,k} = ⊕_{|E(G)| = j} (H^k(∏_v M̄_{g_v,n_v}) ⊗ det E(G))^{Aut(G)}.

Scope: Retain the orientation sheaf even for non-strict normal crossings. The ordinary-cohomology sequence is obtained by duality.

## DWP.9 — Absolute hard Lefschetz and primitive pairings

The invariant-cycle theorem is imported from its pencil owner. Combine it with complete reducibility and the nondegeneracy of invariant pairings to prove absolute hard Lefschetz. A separate graded-operator argument constructs primitive summands, and alternating pairings give parity. Support bounds control the potentially pure complex extension.

Geometric schemes here are separated and noetherian, with ℓ invertible. The finite-type base and the additional smoothness, normality or properness assumptions are those specified in each item.

### 9.1. The Lefschetz operator of a line bundle

Let k be an algebraically closed field, ℓ a prime invertible in k, X a smooth projective k-scheme of pure dimension n, and L a line bundle on X with first Chern class η = c₁(L) ∈ H²(X, ℚ_ℓ(1)) (EDC.3). The Lefschetz operator is L_η = η ∪ − : H^j(X, ℚ_ℓ(m)) → H^{j+2}(X, ℚ_ℓ(m + 1)), and its r-th iterate is cup product with η^r ∈ H^{2r}(X, ℚ_ℓ(r)). For 0 ≤ r ≤ n: the hard Lefschetz map is η^r ∪ − : H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ) → H^{n+r}(X, ℚ_ℓ(r)); the primitive part is P^{n−r}(X) = ker(η^{r+1} ∪ − : H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ) → H^{n+r+2}(X, ℚ_ℓ(r + 1))); the Lefschetz pairing is ψ_r(x, y) = Tr_X(η^r ∪ x ∪ y) ∈ ℚ_ℓ(r − n) for x, y ∈ H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ), where Tr_X : H^{2n}(X, ℚ_ℓ(n)) → ℚ_ℓ is the trace of EDC.2. Tate twists are kept: the source's identification ℤ_ℓ ≅ ℤ_ℓ(1) over k is not used.

API:

- `lefschetzOperator`: lefschetzOperator η : H^j(X, ℚ_ℓ(m)) →ₗ H^{j+2}(X, ℚ_ℓ(m + 1)), x ↦ η ∪ x.

- `lefschetzOperator_pow`: (lefschetzOperator η)^r = cup product with η^r ∈ H^{2r}(X, ℚ_ℓ(r)).

- `lefschetzOperator_smul`: lefschetzOperator (m • η) = m • lefschetzOperator η, and η(L^{⊗m}) = m • η(L).

- `lefschetzOperator_comm_pullback`: For g : X′ → X, g* ∘ L_{η(L)} = L_{η(g*L)} ∘ g*.

- `lefschetzOperator_galois`: For (X, L) defined over k₀ ⊂ k, L_η commutes with the action of Gal(k/k₀).

- `lefschetzOperator_eq_gysin_restrict`: For L very ample and a smooth hyperplane section i : Y → X, L_η = i_* ∘ i*.

- `lefschetzOperator_selfAdjoint`: Tr_X(L_η x ∪ y) = Tr_X(x ∪ L_η y).

- `lefschetzOperator_pow_top`: η^{n+1} = 0 and Tr_X(η^n) = deg_L(X); if L is ample and X is nonempty, this degree is > 0. For X empty, it is 0.

- `primitivePart`: P^{n−r}(X) = ker(η^{r+1} ∪ − on H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ)).

- `lefschetzPairing`: ψ_r(x, y) = Tr_X(η^r ∪ x ∪ y) on H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ), with values in ℚ_ℓ(r − n).

- `lefschetzPairing_symm`: ψ_r(y, x) = (−1)^{n−r} ψ_r(x, y).

Tests:

- `lefschetzOperator_projectiveSpace`: For X = ℙ^n and L = 𝒪(1): H^{2j}(ℙ^n, ℚ_ℓ(j)) = ℚ_ℓ·η^j, L_η(η^j) = η^{j+1} for j < n, η^{n+1} = 0, and Tr(η^n) = 1.

- `lefschetzOperator_trivial_bundle`: For L = 𝒪_X, η = 0 and L_η = 0; on X = ℙ¹, η : H⁰ → H²(1) is the zero map, so ampleness cannot be dropped from hard Lefschetz.

- `lefschetzOperator_degree_zero`: For an elliptic curve E and a line bundle L of degree 0, c₁(L) = 0 in H²(E, ℚ_ℓ(1)) ≅ ℚ_ℓ (the degree), so L_η = 0 although L may be nontrivial.

- `lefschetzOperator_point`: For n = 0 (X a finite set of points) L_η = 0 on H⁰ and P⁰(X) = H⁰(X); the hard Lefschetz map for r = 0 is the identity.

- `lefschetzPairing_curve`: For a smooth projective curve of genus g and L of degree e > 0: ψ₀ on H¹ is Tr(x ∪ y), alternating and nondegenerate on a space of dimension 2g; ψ₁ on H⁰ is x·y·e.

### 9.2. An invariant nondegenerate form stays nondegenerate on the invariants of a completely reducible representation

Let π be a group, K a field, V a finite-dimensional K-vector space with a completely reducible (semisimple) representation of π, and Φ a π-invariant bilinear form on V (Φ(gx, gy) = Φ(x, y) for g ∈ π) which is nondegenerate. Then the restriction of Φ to the invariant subspace V^π is nondegenerate.

Scope: The invariant form may be neither symmetric nor alternating.

### 9.3. Reduction of hard Lefschetz to the middle intersection form on a hyperplane section

Let k be algebraically closed with ℓ invertible, X a smooth projective k-scheme of pure dimension n ≥ 1, L a very ample line bundle, η = c₁(L), i : Y → X the inclusion of a smooth hyperplane section in the embedding defined by L, and η_Y = i*η. (a) The Gysin map i_* : H^j(Y, ℚ_ℓ(m)) → H^{j+2}(X, ℚ_ℓ(m + 1)) is the transpose of i* under Poincaré duality on Y and X, and i_* ∘ i* = L_η. (b) For r ≥ 1 and x ∈ H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ): η^r ∪ x = i_*(η_Y^{r−1} ∪ i*x). (c) (Weak Lefschetz) i* : H^j(X) → H^j(Y) is an isomorphism for j < n − 1 and injective for j = n − 1; dually i_* : H^j(Y) → H^{j+2}(X)(1) is an isomorphism for j > n − 1 and surjective for j = n − 1. (d) Suppose hard Lefschetz holds for (Y, L|_Y). Then η^r ∪ − : H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ) → H^{n+r}(X, ℚ_ℓ(r)) is an isomorphism for every r ≠ 1, and it is an isomorphism for r = 1 iff the form ⟨y, y′⟩ = Tr_Y(y ∪ y′) on H^{n−1}(Y, ℚ_ℓ) is nondegenerate on the image of i* : H^{n−1}(X, ℚ_ℓ) → H^{n−1}(Y, ℚ_ℓ) (Weil II 4.1.2).

### 9.4. Arithmetic models of a polarised smooth projective variety and cospecialisation

For smooth projective pure-dimensional X over algebraically closed k with ℓ invertible, and a very ample embedding X⊂ℙᴺ_k, construct a polarized smooth projective pure-relative-dimensional model X_S⊂ℙᴺ_S over integral finite-type S/ℤ[1/ℓ] through the given k-point. Its smooth proper cohomology sheaves are lisse and commute with base change. Cospecialization preserves the cohomology ring, trace and c₁(L); hard Lefschetz therefore transports from any closed fibre. This model witnesses potential weight-zero purity of the constant sheaf. The family of smooth hyperplane sections also spreads smoothly and projectively, with Rʲg_*ℚ_ℓ potentially pure of weight j.

### 9.5. The image of H^{n−1}(X) in H^{n−1}(Y) is the monodromy invariants

Let k be algebraically closed with ℓ invertible, X a smooth projective k-scheme of pure dimension n ≥ 1 embedded by a very ample L in P = ℙ^N, U = P̌ − X̌ the open of hyperplanes H with X ∩ H smooth, g : Z → U the family of smooth hyperplane sections, u ∈ U(k), Y = Z_u and i : Y → X. Then the image of i* : H^{n−1}(X, ℚ_ℓ) → H^{n−1}(Y, ℚ_ℓ) is the subspace H^{n−1}(Y, ℚ_ℓ)^{π₁(U, u)} of monodromy invariants. If D ⊂ P̌ is a sufficiently general line through u (a Lefschetz pencil when one exists), the image of π₁(D ∩ U, u) in GL(H^{n−1}(Y)) equals that of π₁(U, u), so the image of i* is also H^{n−1}(Y)^{π₁(D ∩ U, u)} (Weil II 4.1.3).

### 9.6. The hard Lefschetz theorem

Let k be an algebraically closed field, ℓ a prime invertible in k, X a smooth projective k-scheme of pure dimension n, L an ample line bundle on X and η = c₁(L) ∈ H²(X, ℚ_ℓ(1)). Then for every r ≥ 0 the map η^r ∪ − : H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ) → H^{n+r}(X, ℚ_ℓ(r)) is an isomorphism. If (X, L) = (X₀, L₀) ⊗_{k₀} k for a subfield k₀ of which k is an algebraic closure, the isomorphism is Gal(k/k₀)-equivariant.

Scope: Use rational ℚ_ℓ coefficients; the integral assertion fails in general.

### 9.7. Primitive decomposition for a graded operator satisfying hard Lefschetz

Let K be a field, n ∈ ℕ, V a finite-dimensional K-vector space which is the internal direct sum of subspaces V^j (0 ≤ j ≤ 2n; V^j = 0 otherwise), and λ ∈ End(V) with λ(V^j) ⊆ V^{j+2}, such that λ^r : V^{n−r} → V^{n+r} is bijective for 0 ≤ r ≤ n. Put P^{n−r} = V^{n−r} ∩ ker λ^{r+1} for 0 ≤ r ≤ n. Then: (i) for 0 ≤ r ≤ n, the maps ⊕_{k ≥ 0} λ^k : ⊕_{k≥0} P^{n−r−2k} → V^{n−r} and ⊕_{k ≥ 0} λ^{r+k} : ⊕_{k≥0} P^{n−r−2k} → V^{n+r} are isomorphisms; (ii) dim P^{n−r} = dim V^{n−r} − dim V^{n−r−2}; (iii) if B is a nondegenerate bilinear form on V with B(V^a, V^b) = 0 unless a + b = 2n and B(λx, y) = B(x, λy), then for 0 ≤ r ≤ n the form ψ_r(x, y) = B(λ^r x, y) on V^{n−r} is nondegenerate, the decomposition (i) of V^{n−r} is ψ_r-orthogonal, and ψ_r restricts to a nondegenerate form on P^{n−r}; if moreover B(y, x) = (−1)^a B(x, y) for x ∈ V^a, then ψ_r is (−1)^{n−r}-symmetric.

### 9.8. Primitive Lefschetz decomposition and nondegenerate Lefschetz pairings

Let k be algebraically closed with ℓ invertible, X a smooth projective k-scheme of pure dimension n, L ample, η = c₁(L). (i) For 0 ≤ r ≤ n, H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ) = ⊕_{k≥0} η^k ∪ P^{n−r−2k}(X)(−k) and H^{n+r}(X, ℚ_ℓ(r)) = ⊕_{k≥0} η^{r+k} ∪ P^{n−r−2k}(X)(−k), where P^{n−r}(X) = ker(η^{r+1} on H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ)) is the primitive part (DWP.9/lefschetz-operator) and η^k ∪ P(−k) denotes the image of P under η^k ∪ − composed with the inverse twist; dim P^{n−r} = b_{n−r} − b_{n−r−2}. (ii) The Lefschetz pairing ψ_r(x, y) = Tr_X(η^r ∪ x ∪ y) on H^{n−r}(X, ℚ_ℓ) is nondegenerate and (−1)^{n−r}-symmetric, the decomposition (i) of H^{n−r} is ψ_r-orthogonal, and ψ_r is nondegenerate on P^{n−r}(X). All these are Gal(k/k₀)-equivariant when (X, L) is defined over k₀.

Scope: Nondegeneracy and graded symmetry are the conclusions; no Hodge–Riemann positivity is required.

### 9.9. A space with a nondegenerate alternating form has even dimension

Let K be a field and V a finite-dimensional K-vector space carrying a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form B (B(x, x) = 0 for all x). Then dim_K V is even.

Let k be algebraically closed with ℓ invertible, X ⊂ P = ℙ^N_k a projective k-scheme, η = c₁(𝒪_X(1)) ∈ H²(X, ℚ_ℓ(1)), and K ∈ D^b_c(X, ℚ̄_ℓ) a potentially pure complex, with a model (S, x̄, X_S ⊂ ℙ^N_S, K_S) witnessing potential purity (DWP.8/potentially-property-p-3-4-10). Let n ∈ ℤ be such that for every i, dim Supp ℋ^i(K) ≤ n − i and dim Supp ℋ^i(DK[−2n]) ≤ n − i (dim ∅ = −∞), where D is duality relative to k. Then for every r ≥ 0 the cup product η^r ∪ − : H^{n−r}(X, K) → H^{n+r}(X, K(r)) is an isomorphism.

Then for every r ≥ 0, η^r ∪ − : H^{n−r}(X, ℱ) → H^{n+r}(X, ℱ(r)) is an isomorphism. In particular this holds for ℱ = R^jh_*ℚ_ℓ of a smooth projective morphism h : Y → X.

### 9.13. Invariant and vanishing cohomology of a hyperplane section are orthogonal complements

Let k be algebraically closed with ℓ invertible, X a smooth projective k-scheme of pure dimension n + 1, L very ample, (X_t)_{t∈D} a Lefschetz pencil of hyperplane sections (LPV.3) with singular set S, u ∈ D − S, Y = X_u, i : Y → X, and E = Ev(Y) ⊂ H^n(Y, ℚ_ℓ) the vanishing subspace (LPV.4). Then H^n(Y, ℚ_ℓ) = i*H^n(X, ℚ_ℓ) ⊕ E, an orthogonal direct sum for the intersection form Tr_Y(x ∪ y), which is nondegenerate on each summand. Consequently E ∩ E^⊥ = 0 (the radical quotient E/(E ∩ E^⊥) of LPV.4 is E itself), and a class that is both invariant under π₁(D − S, u) and vanishing is zero ('Lefschetz's fundamental lemma' over ℚ_ℓ).

Scope: Keep ℚ_ℓ coefficients and the supplied pencil, allowing a Veronese embedding when required.

## DWP.10 — Arithmetic weight transport and finite-field equidistribution

Expose the weight theory in the forms consumed by arithmetic realizations and distribution problems. These targets transport established weights; they do not construct a second Tate module, a second semistable filtration or a private six-operation formalism. The elliptic distribution theorem keeps its precise universal-family monodromy input.

### 10.1. Weights on stable arithmetic subquotients

Let (V,F) be a finite-dimensional invertible Frobenius module and let a commuting algebra of correspondences act on V. Every Frobenius-stable correspondence-stable subquotient of a pure weight-w module is pure of weight w; for a mixed module its actual weights are a subset of those of V. Scalar extension preserves and reflects purity, tensor products add pure weights, duals negate them and an integer Tate twist subtracts 2r. A Hecke eigenspace inherits the conclusion only when it is actually Frobenius-stable. This statement does not imply ℓ-independence of a chosen eigenspace.

### 10.2. Compatible degree factors and point counts

For smooth projective X₀/𝔽_q, the WC.3 integral factors Π_i identify the Weil weight-i root multisets across every ℓ≠p, and WC.5 supplies the all-extension point-count estimate. The endpoint for a pure-dimensional scheme with geometric-component permutation σ is c_n(1+q^(nd)), with c_n=#Fix(σⁿ), rather than a universal single q^(nd). To export a compatible stable arithmetic subquotient, supply a normalized rational factor Q(T), independent of ℓ, whose image is exactly its Frobenius factor in every realization. Under that additional hypothesis its roots and weights agree across realizations; purity of the ambient space alone does not construct Q.

### 10.3. Weights in the semistable curve filtration

For a proper semistable curve over a trait with finite residue field, import LPV.7’s Frobenius-equivariant normalization sequence and monodromy filtration of generic H¹ centered at 1. Its graded pieces H¹(Γ), ⊕H¹(Ỹ_v), H₁(Γ)(−1) have weights respectively 0,1,2. The graph may have a Frobenius permutation, and the normalized components may need finite residue-field extension; these change no weight. This is the finite-residue-field curve consequence, not a general mixed-characteristic weight–monodromy theorem.

### 10.4. Mixed nearby cycles and Newton restrictions

The arithmetic consumers use the already planned DWP.8 theorem that nearby-cycle cohomology sheaves of a mixed sheaf remain mixed, and its proper direct-image purity over ℤ[1/ℓ]. For an integral weight-w eigenvalue, DWP.7’s Newton couple (r,s) satisfies r+s=w and r,s≥0; its cohomological valuation triangles retain the separate compact-support/proper and smooth ordinary hypotheses. DWP.0 supplies the shared numeric Weil/ι-weight predicates to RD.6; RD.6 supplies its own F-isocrystal fibres and defines pointwise purity and mixedness there.

### 10.5. Deligne’s Frobenius equidistribution theorem

In Weil II §2.2’s algebraic-by-ℤ monodromy setting, let X₀/𝔽_q be normal and geometrically connected of dimension N≥1, with the hypotheses (a)–(c) and compact form G_R of DWP.5 (finite kernel is required on the geometric subgroup). Let G_R^i denote degree-i conjugacy classes with the pushforward of normalized compact Haar. For a central z of positive degree d and fixed i, translate by z^(−n) the measure q^(−(nd+i)N) Σ_(x∈X₀(𝔽_(q^(nd+i)))) δ_[ιF_x,ss]. As n→∞ it converges weakly to Haar on the degree-i conjugacy fibre. The sum is over rational points with Frobenius powers, and normalization uses the base dimension N. This is Weil II (3.5.3), not Weil I’s estimate or density of individual Weil numbers.

For a smooth elliptic family E₀→C₀ over a smooth geometrically connected finite-field curve with nonconstant j, use the imported full SL₂ geometric monodromy of the universal-family comparison.

The common predicates and transports must reproduce: H^(2r)(ℙᴺ)=ℚ_ℓ(−r) of weight 2r and vanishing odd cohomology; H⁰(𝔾_m)=ℚ_ℓ of weight 0, H¹(𝔾_m)=ℚ_ℓ(−1) of weight 2, H¹_c(𝔾_m)=ℚ_ℓ of weight 0 and H²_c(𝔾_m)=ℚ_ℓ(−1) of weight 2; H¹ of a smooth projective genus-g curve of weight 1 with reciprocal pairs α_iα_(i+g)=q; the finite-residue-field semistable graded weights 0,1,2; and the component-aware all-extension point count. In Yu’s unitary Rankin–Selberg use, supplied Lafforgue correspondences make ℱ₁⊗ℱ₂∨ pure of weight zero; its proper curve cohomological factors have distinct weights 0,1,2 and cannot cancel. Correspondence construction, automorphic poles and functional equations remain with their existing owners.
