# Roadmap: locally analytic distributions, growth and character spaces

This roadmap builds the spaces of locally analytic functions and distributions on ℤ_p, on finite products of rings of integers of p-adic fields and on compact p-adic analytic manifolds, together with the three things that the constructions of non-ordinary p-adic L-functions, p-adic regulators and p-adic families need from them: the unbounded Amice transform and its operator toolbox, the theory of admissible (order-r and vector-order) distributions with the Amice–Vélu–Vishik extension and uniqueness theorem, and the Mellin transform identifying distributions on a compact abelian p-adic analytic group with analytic functions on its character space. The last layer supplies the operator theory of p-adic families: complete continuity over a Banach algebra, Fredholm determinants, Riesz projectors and finite-slope decompositions, the Coleman spectral transform, and finite-slope perfect complexes. Everything is stated over a complete nonarchimedean field K (a finite extension of ℚ_p in the arithmetic applications) and, for families, over a commutative Noetherian K-Banach algebra A; general locally convex or distribution spaces are never silently treated as Banach spaces.

The targets below are specifications for formalisation. Every definition comes with the API it needs and with checks that a plausible wrong definition fails; every theorem carries its hypotheses, its source and the earlier targets or library declarations it rests on. The companion [Suggested.lean](Suggested.lean) proposes signatures and `example` tests for the targets that can be stated against the pinned libraries; it is not the roadmap and not exhaustive, and this document is definitive.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns the following material.

- Pointwise realization of native restricted series on translated closed discs and finite polydisc charts, with the maximum-principle comparison, the Banach stages of functions analytic on every residue ball of a fixed radius, the compact-type space of locally analytic functions and its strong dual of distributions, in one variable, on finite products of local integer rings (distinguishing ℚ_p-analytic from F-analytic functions) and on compact p-adic analytic manifolds through charts.
- The strict-sequence and three-space results for nonarchimedean Banach, Fréchet and compact-type spaces that are used to pass between stages, limits and duals, including the nonarchimedean Hahn–Banach theorem over a spherically complete field, which is stated here as a target rather than taken from another roadmap.
- The unbounded Amice transform (distributions ↔ power series convergent on the open disc) with its Fréchet topology, and the operator dictionary: point masses, convolution, multiplication by the coordinate, character twists, clopen restriction, the transpose derivative and the logarithm, dilation, φ and ψ, division by the coordinate on the units, local primitives, and the non-splitting of differentiation and of the logarithm sequence.
- Functions of class C^r, distributions of order r, the identification of order zero with bounded measures, the Amice–Vélu–Vishik theorem with the strict degree bound, vector order on ℤ_p^g through completed tensors of one-variable spaces, rectangular growth bounds, the critical counterexample, and the ray-class growth adapters.
- Component Mellin series of bounded measures, arithmetic branches ω(x)^i⟨x⟩^s, clearing factors for pseudo-measures, the distribution Mellin transform as a Fréchet algebra isomorphism onto the functions on the open polydisc with its evaluation, multiplicativity, generator-change, weight-derivative, twist, functoriality and coefficient-extension laws, and the comparison with the rigid and adic character spaces.
- Complete continuity in the Banach-algebra convention, orthonormalizable and potentially orthonormalizable modules, property (Pr), the Fredholm determinant and its invariance, product and base-change laws, entire series and their division by monic polynomials, resultants of monic polynomials against entire series, Hasse derivatives, the Fredholm resolvent, Riesz projectors at a root, finite generation and projectivity of root kernels, the finite spectral transform, Coleman's truncation limits, Gauss convergence of entire series, affinoid-valued stages and their duals, the universal-character coefficient action, compactness of contracting operators, Banach cochain complexes with compact homotopy endomorphisms, numerical slope decompositions, finite-slope perfect complexes, Fréchet presentations, Stein exhaustions and the torus order on slopes.

It leaves the following to the roadmaps and libraries named, and does not restate them.

- **Bounded measures and their calculus** belong to PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras: the carrier D(X, R) (Mathlib's `AbstractMeasure`), clopen restriction and extension, the weak and strong topologies (its L0); the bounded Mahler–Amice transform `AbstractMeasure.amiceTransform`, the Mahler derivation, translation, dilation, φ, ψ, residue restriction and the inversion of multiplication by x on the units for bounded measures (its L2); pseudo-measures, admissible evaluation and the independence of the clearing factor (its L3); the character space W of ℤ_pˣ with its odd-p and p = 2 decompositions, the identification of characters of the principal units with the open unit disc, measures as bounded functions on W, pseudo-measure clearing presentations on the nonvanishing character domain, and the universal character Γ → Λˣ (its L0a). Layers 1–3 here extend each of these from bounded measures to distributions; where a target of this roadmap specialises to a bounded measure it must agree with the PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras statement, and that agreement is part of the target.
- **Rigid and adic carriers** belong to the Tau Ceti roadmap AdicSpaces (restricted power series and Tate algebras in its Layer 0, gluing of adic spaces in its Layer 5) and to AdicSpacesPartII (the complete-continuity predicate over affinoid algebras and its ideal and closure API, quasi-Stein spaces and Theorems A and B, in its R3). The comparison of the power-series character space with these geometric objects is a target of Layer 3; the geometric objects themselves are not built here, and diamonds are never required.
- **Already in the Tau Ceti library** (`a91d3aaf`) and used, not restated: `TauCeti.Algebra.eval_charpolyRev_leftMulMatrix` (`RingTheory/Norm/CharpolyRev.lean`) supplies the characteristic-series norm identity for a chosen finite basis; `Matrix.mul_apply_diag_of_isUpperTriangular` and `Matrix.pow_apply_diag_of_isUpperTriangular` (`LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Triangular.lean`) supply the diagonal product and power identities for §4.10; Mathlib's restricted series `PowerSeries.IsRestricted` with Tau Ceti's `TauCeti.PowerSeries.isRestricted_of_abs_le`, `isRestricted_polynomial` (so "polynomials are entire" is a consequence, not a target of Layer 4), `polynomialToRestricted`, the Gauss norm `TauCeti.PowerSeries.gaussValuation` with its multiplicativity and `IsDistinguished` on restricted series, and the normed-ring structure `TauCeti.PowerSeries.norm_eq_gaussNorm` on the restricted subring at a radius (`TauCeti/RingTheory/PowerSeries/{Restricted,GaussNorm,TateAlgebra}.lean`); `TauCeti.PowerSeries.IsDistinguished.existsUnique_mul_add_eq` (`RingTheory/PowerSeries/Weierstrass/Division.lean`) supplies division at a single radius under a multiplicative coefficient norm, whereas §4.3 needs an all-radius monic quotient over a possibly nonreduced ring with only a submultiplicative norm; `TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesGaussEquiv` identifying the Huber restricted series with the Gauss-normed ones; `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.isUnit_one_sub` (`Topology/Algebra/Nonarchimedean/GeometricSeries.lean`); the integer-coefficient evaluation `TauCeti.evalIntSeries` (`Topology/Algebra/InfiniteSum/IntegralCoefficients.lean`), used only for series with integer coefficients; the logarithm has coefficients (−1)^(n+1)/n and requires the open-disc summability and evaluation of §1.2; the completed group algebra `TauCeti.completedGroupAlgebra` and its `powerSeriesCoordinate`, consumed through PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras. Tau Ceti's `Analysis/Fredholm/*` (the index theory of `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm`) and `Analysis/Normed/Operator/Compact/RieszTheory.lean` (Riesz theory for Mathlib's `IsCompactOperator`) concern operators between Banach spaces over a field, with hypotheses varying by theorem; some results, including finite-dimensional kernel statements, apply over nonarchimedean fields; the Fredholm theory of Layer 4 is over a Banach algebra A with complete continuity defined by finitely generated A-images, and no comparison with `IsCompactOperator` is asserted anywhere in this roadmap: a target that needs one must state it with its own hypotheses.
- **Reductive-group input** belongs to ReductiveGroups Layer 7 and ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.1 (the torus, roots and apartment valuation). RG2.1 also owns the maximal bounded/compact kernel, translation lattice and quotient. The slope valuation uses the opposite sign from that translation; its geometric-character comparison and the positive torus monoids are the additional targets of §4.17; no root datum is built here.
- **Not in this roadmap at all**: no p-adic L-function (no Bernoulli, Eisenstein, modular-symbol or Rankin–Selberg arithmetic), no Coleman map or Coleman integration, no eigenvariety or overconvergent cohomology, no (φ, Γ)-modules, no Galois cohomology, no diamonds, and no solid or condensed functional analysis: the finite-window statement of §4.17 is a classical statement about Fréchet presentations and makes no solid-localisation claim.

## Conventions

1. **Fields and algebras.** K is a field complete for a nontrivial nonarchimedean absolute value; in the arithmetic layers K is a finite extension of ℚ_p with v_p(p) = 1, and L ⊆ ℂ_p denotes a closed subfield containing the relevant coefficients. A is a nonzero commutative Noetherian K-Banach algebra with a submultiplicative ultrametric norm; A is not assumed to be a field, reduced or affinoid, and the zero algebra is treated as a separate degenerate case. Banach A-modules are complete Hausdorff ultrametric normed K-spaces with a bounded A-action; operator norms of continuous A-linear maps are computed after restriction of scalars to K.
2. **Charts and coefficients.** A normalised analytic chart on a residue ball has coordinate (x − a)/p^h. The coefficient space of a Banach stage is Mathlib's c₀, `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap` on a discrete index type I (`C₀(I, A)`), with no countability assumption; in several variables the coefficients tend to zero along the cofinite filter on the multi-index set. For an operator u on c₀ write u(e_i) = Σ_j a_{ij} e_j, so that i is the input index and j the output index, and r_j(u) = sup_i ‖a_{ij}‖; finite coordinate projections π_S retain a finite set of output coordinates.
3. **Topologies.** The locally analytic functions carry the inductive-limit topology of the Banach stages. Distributions carry the projective limit of the Banach dual topologies. Over finite K/Q_p, §0.3 compares this with the strong dual topology of the compact-type function space; over general closed L⊆ℂ_p only the projective-limit distribution topology is claimed here. Equality of underlying functions is never equality of topologies: the locally analytic topology is strictly finer than the uniform one. These nonarchimedean locally convex objects are not instances of Mathlib's ordered-field `LocallyConvexSpace`. The dual of a Banach stage has bounded coefficient values and is not asserted to be a c₀ space.
4. **Series.** A series on the open disc satisfies ‖a_n‖R^n → 0 for every 0 < R < 1; an entire series satisfies it for every real R > 0. Both carry the Fréchet topology of all Gauss norms, which governs evaluation and limits; neither is given a single radius-one norm. Mathlib's `PowerSeries` and `MvPowerSeries` are the carriers; restricted series at one radius are Mathlib's `PowerSeries.IsRestricted`.
5. **Amice and Mellin normalisations.** The Amice transform of a distribution μ on ℤ_p is Σ_n μ(binom(x, n)) T^n, and Y = 1 + T, so δ_a ↦ Y^a. The transpose derivative is (dμ)(f) = μ(f′), with multiplier log(1 + T); multiplication by x is (1 + T)d/dT. Mellin branches use ω(x)^i⟨x⟩^s with no shift s ↦ 1 − s. At odd p the topological generator of the principal units is 1 + p; at p = 2 the units are {±1} × (1 + 4ℤ_2) with generator 5. Full ℚ_p-analytic Mellin transforms live on the full character space; F-analytic distributions satisfy the closed differential relations of §0.1 and use the F-analytic character subspace.
6. **Operators.** P_u(T) = det(1 − Tu) with c_0 = 1 and c_n = (−1)^n times the sum of the principal n × n minors. "Finite rank" means image contained in a finitely generated A-submodule (not finite K-dimension, not necessarily free), "completely continuous" means approximable in operator norm by such maps, and neither is identified with Mathlib's `IsCompactOperator`. Q*(X) = X^{deg Q} Q(1/X). Root multiplicity is read from Hasse derivatives, the first nonzero one being a unit. In the Riesz theory, v = 1 − au, z_s = Δ_s F_u(a), c = Δ_h P_u(a) is a unit, b = c⁻¹ z_h, p = (vb)^h and E = 1 − p; E projects onto N = ker(v^h) and p onto its regular complement; at h = 0, E = 0 and N = 0.
7. **Entire division.** The entire-division targets state weaker hypotheses than the standing ones: A complete, commutative, normed with ‖1‖ = 1, ultrametric only where stated; the parameter a is arbitrary; the native `PowerSeries`, `IsEntire`, `entire_eval` and `Polynomial.divByMonic` are reused; a total `tsum` outside the entire subring is never treated as a convergent evaluation. For monic Q, ρ_Q is entire division followed by `AdjoinRoot`, and Res(Q, F) is `Algebra.norm (ρ_Q F)`; the degree-zero quotient is the zero ring, so Res(1, F) = 1. No domain, reducedness or root-splitting hypothesis is used.
8. **Vector order.** Anisotropic C^{r_i} on ℤ_p^g means the completed projective tensor product of the one-variable C^{r_i} spaces; rectangular coset bounds are separate in each conductor exponent. The literal simultaneous first-difference condition is not used (see the source corrections in the references).
9. **Complexes and slopes.** Banach complexes are Mathlib `CochainComplex`es in `ModuleCat` with complete degree norms, continuous differentials and (Pr) terms, possibly of infinite rank; a compact homotopy class has a degreewise completely continuous representative; its auxiliary characteristic series is the non-alternating product of the degree Fredholm series and depends on the representative, while finite-slope cohomology is the invariant. Slope ≤ h includes equality, both in the finite-summand annihilation and in the complementary polynomial-invertibility test; in det(1 − TU) coordinates, eigenvalues of valuation ≤ h correspond to reciprocal roots of valuation ≥ −h.
10. **Families.** Analytic c₀ stages commute with completed projective coefficient tensors; their infinite Banach duals have only a canonical scalar-extension map, and no unqualified isomorphism or automatic (Pr) property is asserted for them. For an affinoid A with a chosen Banach model, the norm unit ball is the integral lattice; it is not identified with the power-bounded elements of a non-reduced affinoid without proof.
11. **Roots of unity.** A formula summing over μ_{p^n} (the clopen-restriction formula of §1.1 and §1.4, the finite Fourier inversions of §2.2) is stated after extending the coefficient field to contain μ_{p^n}; the result descends to the original field because the left-hand side is defined there.
12. **Generality of the Lean signatures.** Each statement records its norm, scalar-action and ultrametric hypotheses explicitly. Algebraic matrix identities may be stated over a commutative ring, and elementary series identities over a complete normed ring, when their target says so. The component and branch Mellin targets of §3.1–§3.2 use a complete ultrametric field with a bounded ℤ_p-algebra structure; they do not use inversion of p. Arithmetic formulas with p⁻ⁿ, logarithms and roots of unity require the characteristic-zero coefficient fields specified at those targets. An abstract continuous transpose on fixed normed spaces does not by itself provide the global locally analytic map or its strong-topology comparison.
13. **Witnesses for the conventions.** Each normalisation is pinned by one computed instance, repeated as an `example` in `Suggested.lean`. Amice: δ_a ↦ (1 + T)^a, so x·δ_1 = δ_1 ↦ 1 + T = (1 + T)·d/dT(1 + T), which fixes ∂ = (1 + T)d/dT rather than d/dT (whose value would be 1). Transpose derivative: for μ = dδ_a (f ↦ f′(a)) the coefficients μ(binom(x, n)) are 1 for n = 1 and a − 1/2 for n = 2, which are the first two coefficients of log(1 + T)·(1 + T)^a = T + (a − 1/2)T² + …; the opposite sign convention (dμ)(f) = −μ(f′) would give −log(1 + T). Clopen restriction: for δ_a and the class b + pℤ_p the formula p⁻¹Σ_{η ∈ μ_p} η^{−b}(1 + T)^a η^a equals (1 + T)^a when a ≡ b and 0 otherwise. Fredholm series: for u = a·id on A, P_u = 1 − aT, so c_1 = −tr u and the zero operator has P = 1; the 2 × 2 nilpotent Jordan block also has P = 1. Riesz: for u = id on A, a = 1 and h = 1, c = Δ_1 P_u(1) = −1 is a unit, v = 0, N = A and E = 1. Slope endpoint: for u = a·id with v_p(a) = h the eigenvalue a lies in the ≤ h summand, and its reciprocal root a⁻¹ has valuation −h ≥ −h. Reciprocal polynomial: (X − a)* = 1 − aX. Resultant: Res(1, F) = 1 and Res(X − a, F) = F(a) with no sign. Hasse derivative: Δ_2(T²) = 1 in every characteristic, while the second ordinary derivative of T² is 0 in characteristic 2. Mellin: for δ_u on ℤ_pˣ with u = γ^m in the principal-unit component, the component series is (1 + T)^m, its value at the trivial character (t = 0) is 1, the total mass, and at p = 2 the two components are indexed by ω(x) = ±1 with ⟨−1⟩ = 1. Clearing: the expression F(t)/(κ_t(a) − 1) is defined only where κ_t(a) ≠ 1, which excludes the trivial character; a pole-order bound additionally requires a denominator that is not identically zero, and is bounded by its vanishing multiplicity; no value is asserted at a zero denominator.
14. **Names.** All new declarations live under `TauCeti.`; the namespaces named in each layer are proposals. Names follow Mathlib's conventions (`foo_bar` for theorems, `fooBar` for data, `IsFoo` for predicates).

What is assumed of each is exactly its statement at that commit.

**From PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras.** L0: bounded measures D(X, L) = C⁰(X, L)′ on ℤ_p and ℤ_pˣ with their norm, the weak and strong topologies, clopen restriction and extension, and the injectivity of restriction to a dense subspace of test functions. L2: the bounded Amice transform with coefficient μ(binom(x, n)), its inverse on bounded coefficient sequences, the Dirac, convolution, φ, ψ, dilation, residue-restriction and unit-restriction laws, and the inversion of multiplication by x on the units. L0a: the character space W(A) = Hom_cts(ℤ_pˣ, Aˣ) with its torsion/principal decomposition at odd p and at p = 2, the identification of characters of the principal units with the open disc through a chosen generator, measures as bounded functions on W, pseudo-measure clearing presentations on the nonvanishing character domain, the universal character and its universal property for G = H × ℤ_p^d; in addition the locally analytic chart H : G ≅ Δ × ℤ_p^d and the component points κ_{ν,t}(g) = ν(H_Δ g)(1 + t)^{H_ℤ g}. L3: pseudo-measures λ with ([g] − 1)λ in the algebra, admissible evaluation after clearing a denominator whose character value is a unit, and independence of the clearing factor; Layer 3 here needs in addition the identification of the genuine clearing numerator for ([a] − [1])λ and the cross-compatibility of two clearings on their common non-vanishing domain, which that roadmap's pointwise numerator and ratio targets supply.

The predicate "completely continuous" for continuous linear maps between Banach modules over an affinoid algebra, with its finite-rank, composition, ideal and closure API; Layer 4 states the same approximation predicate over a Noetherian K-Banach algebra (§4.1) and requires the two to agree on affinoids. Quasi-Stein spaces, dense restriction maps and Theorems A and B, used by §4.17 for Stein exhaustions.

**From the Tau Ceti roadmaps AdicSpaces and ReductiveGroupsPartII.** AdicSpaces Layer 0 supplies restricted series, Tate algebras and strong noetherianness, and Layer 5 open subspaces and gluing for §3.4. ReductiveGroups Layer 7 supplies the torus, root datum and dominant chambers. ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.1's `torusValuationMap` on the minimal Levi Z is normalized by 〈χ,v(z)〉=−ω(χ(z)) on rational characters; its `boundedPart` is the maximal bounded subgroup, `boundedPart_isCompact` applies over local fields, and `translationLattice` is the full image lattice with Z(K)/boundedPart≃Λ. For a quasi-split Borel the minimal Levi is T itself. §4.17 consumes these kernel/lattice/quotient results, constructs the positive normalized adapter on geometric characters, and proves the positive-monoid spanning comparison. It does not re-plan the imported kernel or lattice theorem. See RG2.1 “The valuation homomorphism of the minimal Levi”, Bruhat–Tits II §§4.2.5–4.2.7, pp. 90–91.


## How to read the build

Layer 0 builds the function spaces and the functional-analytic tools; Layer 1 the Amice transform and the operator toolbox on ℤ_p; Layer 2 admissibility and uniqueness in one and several variables; Layer 3 the Mellin transform and character spaces; Layer 4 the operator theory of families and the finite-slope complexes. Each layer is divided into numbered subsections; a subsection opens with the hypotheses that all its targets share, then states its targets in dependency order as bold-titled paragraphs. A paragraph gives the statement, any further hypotheses, the API of a definition or construction as a list of named lemmas, the source with its locator, and *Needs*, the earlier targets (by subsection number and title), library declarations and supplier layers it rests on. The checks of a definition or construction are the `**Checks.**` bullets under it, one per unit test; the tests whose carriers are available at the pins are `example`s in [Suggested.lean](Suggested.lean); the closing comment lists the remaining targets. Each layer ends with worked examples and its dependencies. Nothing is optional.

## Layer 0: analytic Banach stages, locally analytic functions and their strong duals

This layer builds the function spaces. Analytic functions on a closed disc with their Gauss valuation are the local building blocks; functions analytic on every residue ball of a fixed radius form the Banach stages `LA_h`, whose union is the space of locally analytic functions with its compact-type inductive-limit topology; the projective-limit dual is the space of locally analytic distributions, with bounded measures inside it. Over finite coefficient extensions these duals have the strong topology. The layer then records the strict-sequence and three-space results that are used to pass between Banach, Fréchet and compact-type spaces, and the chart-based construction on finite products of polydiscs and compact p-adic manifolds, with the completed tensor and strong-duality statements that the later layers use. Proposed home: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/LocallyAnalytic` (one variable) and `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/AnalyticDistributions` (charts and polydiscs).

### 0.0 Nonarchimedean topology, exact categories and completed tensors

Here K is a complete nontrivially valued ultrametric field. The categorical lattice constructions work under these hypotheses; compact-type regularity and strong duality below are restricted to finite K/Q_p. Write O_K={a:|a|≤1}. The constructions allow arbitrary index sets, not just sequences. This subsection supplies the topology before the analytic spaces use it. Sources: Schneider, *Nonarchimedean Functional Analysis*, author notes §4, Propositions 4.3–4.4, pp. 18–19, and §5, pp. 21–30, §17, pp. 109–114; Colmez–Dospinescu–Nizioł, *Cohomology of p-adic Stein spaces*, arXiv:1801.06686v2, §2.1.1–§2.1.3, pp. 7–10. The categorical distinctions below are derived using the lattice constructions in those passages.

**Locally convex spaces and separation** (construction). `NACvx K` has topological K-vector spaces (jointly continuous addition and scalar multiplication) with a zero-neighbourhood basis of open O_K-submodules, and continuous K-linear maps. Equivalently its topology is defined by a family of ultrametric K-seminorms; no ordered-field `LocallyConvexSpace` instance is used. `HANACvx K` is the full subcategory of Hausdorff objects. `separate E` is E divided by the intersection of its zero-neighbourhoods, with quotient topology, and is left adjoint to the inclusion of the Hausdorff category. Kernels in either category have the subspace topology. In NACvx the cokernel of f is the algebraic quotient F/f(E); in HANACvx it is F/closure(f(E)). The latter distinction is necessary even for dense Banach injections. API: `naLocallyConvex_iff_seminorms`, `naKernel`, `naCokernel`, `haCokernel`, `separate_lift` (factorization of every continuous map to a Hausdorff object), `separate_idempotent` and `separate_eq_self_iff`. Build with native modules, submodules and quotient topologies.

**Checks.**

- `naTopology_line`: On K the balls |x|<r form open O_K-lattices and define the given norm topology. The zero space is Hausdorff.
- `naTopology_product`: On K^N the product topology is generated by finitely many coordinate bounds. The vectors e_n tend to zero there; their sup norms remain one. A single sup-norm topology would fail this check.
- `naCokernel_dense`: The inclusion of finitely supported sequences into c₀(N,K), with the inherited norm, has a nonzero algebraic quotient whose separated quotient is zero. Taking an algebraic quotient and declaring it Hausdorff gives the wrong cokernel.

**Locally convex limits** (construction). `naInductiveLimit E` is the algebraic direct limit with the finest locally convex topology making all structure maps continuous. Its open lattices are precisely those with open inverse image at every stage. `naProjectiveLimit E` is the compatible submodule of the product with the initial topology for its projections. Apply `separate` if a Hausdorff colimit is required. For countable Banach systems with injective compact transitions over finite K/Q_p, the inductive limit is Hausdorff, complete and regular: every bounded subset is contained and bounded in one stage. This is the compact-type theorem, not a property of every inductive system. API: `naInductiveLimit_lift`, `naInductiveLimit_continuous_iff` for linear maps out, `naProjectiveLimit_lift`, `naProjectiveLimit_topology`, `compactType_bounded_stage`, `compactType_complete`. Sources for the last two: Schneider–Teitelbaum, arXiv:math/9912073v1, §1, Theorem 1.1, pp. 3–4; Schneider notes §16, pp. 103–108.

**Checks.**

- `naLimit_constant`: Constant identity systems on K have both limits K with its norm topology; the constant zero system has zero limit.
- `naLimit_product`: The inverse limit of K^n under coordinate deletion is K^N with product topology, not c₀ or the bounded-sequence space. The family (1,1,...) is in this limit.
- `naLimit_radius`: For analytic stages on Z_p, p^n binom(x,p^(2n)) tends to zero uniformly, but lies in no bounded set of one fixed analytic stage. By regularity it cannot converge in LA. This distinguishes the locally convex inductive topology from the uniform topology.

**Strict maps and the quasi-abelian categories** (construction). In NACvx a morphism is strict when the quotient topology on E/ker f agrees with the subspace topology on f(E); equivalently it is relatively open onto its image. In HANACvx strictness additionally requires f(E) closed, because its categorical image is closure(f(E)). Use the native topological `IsStrictMap` for the quotient-to-image comparison and record the closed-image condition separately. Both categories are quasi-abelian by the following lattice calculation: pullbacks of strict quotient epimorphisms remain quotient epimorphisms, and pushouts of strict embeddings remain strict embeddings (closed embeddings in the Hausdorff category). Construct the pullback as a subspace of a product, and the pushout as (F⊕G)/{(f(e),−g(e))}; given an open lattice L_G in G, choose an open lattice L_F in F with f^(−1)(L_F)⊂g^(−1)(L_G), using the induced topology on the embedded E. The image of L_F⊕L_G in the pushout intersects G in L_G, proving its induced topology. In the Hausdorff case the relation graph and the preimage of G are closed, proving that the embedding remains closed. These stability lemmas, together with the kernel/cokernel constructions, supply the quasi-abelian structure. API: `naStrict_iff_relativelyOpen`, `haStrict_iff_closed_and_naStrict`, `naStrict_pullback`, `naStrict_pushout`, `haStrict_pullback`, `haStrict_pushout`, `naQuasiAbelian`, `haQuasiAbelian`. A Hausdorff strictly exact sequence therefore has a closed kernel embedding and a surjective quotient map. No normed open-mapping theorem constructs the categories.

**Checks.**

- `strict_split_line`: K→K², x↦(x,0), followed by (x,y)↦y is strictly exact; its pullback along 0→K is K and its pushout along K→0 is K.
- `strict_dense_inclusion`: The finitely supported inclusion in c₀ is strict in NACvx, but fails Hausdorff categorical strictness because the image is dense and proper.
- `strict_diagonal_failure`: On c₀(N,Q_p), T(x)_n=p^n x_n is continuous, injective and has dense proper range, but is not relatively open. The unit vectors have norm one while |T(e_n)|=p^(−n) tends to zero. Even its quotient-to-algebraic-image inverse is discontinuous.

**Left hearts and strict exactness** (construction). Construct `naLeftHeart` and `haLeftHeart` from the strict derived category of the corresponding quasi-abelian category. Use native bounded cochain complexes and their homotopy category. Define `naStrictDerivedCategory` as its Verdier localization by the thick subcategory of strictly acyclic complexes; define `haStrictDerivedCategory` in the same way. Stability of strict exactness under cones and translations follows from the lattice kernel/cokernel calculus. The left truncation through degree n ends in ker(d_n) at degree n; the complementary truncation starts with coim(d_(n−1))→E_n in degrees n−1,n. Consequently left cohomology is the monomorphism [coim(d_(n−1))→ker(d_n)] in degrees −1,0. Orthogonality and the truncation triangles give `naLeftTStructure` and `haLeftTStructure`. Their hearts are the promised abelian categories. An object is represented by a monomorphism E→F in degrees −1,0; invert squares whose mapping cones are strictly exact. The fully faithful embedding `naHeartEmbedding` (respectively `haHeartEmbedding`) sends V to [0→V]. Its essential image is extension closed, and an embedded complex is exact in the heart if and only if the original complex is strictly exact. An embedded short extension is thus represented by a strict short exact sequence, with no need to assume beforehand that its middle term is classical. An object [E→F] is classical exactly when the injection is strict, in which case it is the categorical cokernel. In NACvx a non-Hausdorff cokernel remains classical; it must not silently be replaced by its separated quotient. The three-space results below use the NACvx heart with Hausdorff outer terms; their strict middle space is Hausdorff as well. API: `naLeftHeart_monoPresentation`, `naHeartEmbedding_fullyFaithful`, `naHeartEmbedding_extensionClosed`, `naHeartEmbedding_exact_iff_strictExact`, `naHeart_classical_iff_strict`; the same five statements with `ha` prefix. API for the derived construction: `naStrictDerivedCategory_localization`, `naStrictDerivedCategory_acyclic_iff_zero`, `naLeftTStructure_truncation`, `naLeftCohomology_monoModel` and the corresponding `ha` statements. Proof input: native `CochainComplex`, `HomotopyCategory` and categorical localization, strict-kernel/cokernel calculus above and the left-heart construction in Colmez–Dospinescu–Nizioł §2.1.1, pp. 7–9 (compare Schneiders, Proposition 1.2.27, Corollary 1.2.28 and Proposition 1.2.29, pp. 26–29).

**Checks.**

- `heart_split_line`: The preceding split sequence gives the extension of [0→K] by [0→K] with middle [0→K²], in either heart.
- `heart_identity`: [K→K] with identity is zero in the strict derived category and the heart; [0→K] is the embedded line, not zero.
- `derived_split`: The three-term split complex K→K²→K is strictly acyclic and becomes zero; its two-term truncation [K→K²] is the embedded quotient K.
- `heart_dense_diagonal`: [c₀→c₀] with T(x)_n=p^n x_n is nonclassical in either heart. Its Hausdorff cokernel is zero, so replacing every monomorphism complex by its separated cokernel loses this object. The finitely supported inherited-norm inclusion, in contrast, is classical in the NACvx heart with its non-Hausdorff quotient.

**Projective tensor and separated completion** (construction). On the existing algebraic E⊗_K F put the projective locally convex topology with open lattices generated by L⊗_(O_K) M for open lattices L⊂E and M⊂F. For defining seminorms p,q, the tensor seminorm at u is inf over finite expressions u=Σ x_i⊗y_i of max_i p(x_i)q(y_i). `naProjectiveTensor E F` represents jointly continuous bilinear maps. `naCompletedProjectiveTensor E F` is its separated uniform completion; it represents these maps into complete Hausdorff locally convex spaces H via continuous linear maps to H. The algebraic tensor map has dense range. API: `projectiveTensor_tmul`, `projectiveTensor_lift`, `projectiveTensor_lift_unique`, `completedProjectiveTensor_lift`, `completedProjectiveTensor_dense`, `projectiveTensor_pureNorm` for Banach factors. Source: Schneider §17, Lemma 17.2, Proposition 17.4 and Corollary 17.5, pp. 110–113. Proof uses the lattice topology, the seminorm infimum, separation and the universal property of native uniform completion, rather than a new algebraic tensor carrier.

**Checks.**

- `projectiveTensor_pure`: For normed factors, ‖x⊗y‖_π=‖x‖‖y‖, and for K⊗̂_π E the map a⊗x↦ax is an isomorphism. A sum-norm formula without the ultrametric maximum fails the first test on two independent basis vectors.
- `projectiveTensor_zero`: Zero⊗̂_π E=0, including E=0; the unique bilinear map factors uniquely.
- `projectiveTensor_completion`: Σ_(n≥0) p^n e_n⊗e_n gives the diagonal coefficient array in c₀(N²,K). Its infinite-rank matrix is not in the algebraic tensor (whose matrices have finite rank). An uncompleted algebraic model fails this check.

**Inductive tensor and analytic compact-type comparison** (construction). `naInductiveTensor E F` gives E⊗F the finest locally convex topology for which its canonical bilinear map is separately continuous; it represents separately continuous bilinear maps. `naCompletedInductiveTensor` is the separated completion and has that universal property for complete Hausdorff targets. The identity induces E⊗_ι F→E⊗_π F, since joint continuity implies separate continuity. For Fréchet factors the two topologies and completions agree (Schneider Proposition 17.6, p. 114). For compact-type presentations E=lim E_h and F=lim F_k, the inductive tensor is obtained from lim_(h,k)(E_h⊗_π F_k); for the analytic stages below this system is again compact type and complete, so its limit identifies with E⊗̂_ι F. Use regularity and the lattice universal property to compare the topologies, then compact transitions on the tensor stages to prove completeness. This is a stagewise projective comparison; it makes no blanket assertion that π and ι agree for arbitrary inductive limits. API: `inductiveTensor_lift`, `completedInductiveTensor_lift`, `inductiveTensor_to_projective`, `frechetTensor_pi_eq_iota`, `analyticCompactTensor_stageLimit`, `analyticCompactTensor_product`.

**Checks.**

- `inductiveTensor_pure`: Two polynomial test functions x^i and y^j map to x^i y^j on the product manifold; the order of coordinates is preserved.
- `inductiveTensor_point_empty`: A point factor gives LA(X,K); an empty manifold factor gives zero.
- `inductiveTensor_radius`: An analytic tensor may require a larger radius index than either displayed presentation. Its inclusion must be induced by the two radius transitions. The diagonal infinite coefficient array above belongs to the completed stage; a finite-sum-only tensor loses it. In §2.2 the tensor 1⊗1_(pZ_p) additionally distinguishes the projective C^r product from the false simultaneous-difference definition.

**Orthonormal bases and coefficient extension** (comparison). For arbitrary discrete I,J, c₀(I,K)⊗̂_π c₀(J,K)≃c₀(I×J,K) is isometric, sending e_i⊗e_j to e_(i,j). For a complete ultrametric Banach K-algebra A, c₀(I,K)⊗̂_π A≃c₀(I,A), with e_i⊗a mapped to the coefficient a at i. With isometric scalar action these are isometries; an equivalent chosen Banach norm gives a continuous equivalence with its stated constants. Prove equality of the tensor norm and the finite coefficient maximum, then density of finite support and completeness. This proves LA_h(L)=LA_h(Q_p)⊗̂_π L even for a general closed L⊂C_p. API: `c0CompletedTensor_equiv`, `c0CompletedTensor_basis`, `c0CompletedScalar_equiv`, `c0CompletedScalar_basis`, `c0CompletedScalar_naturality`. Needs: completed projective tensor above and native c₀ finite-support density.

**Checks.**

- `c0Tensor_basis`: e_2⊗e_3 has coefficient one at (2,3) and zero at (3,2); e_2⊗a has norm ‖a‖.
- `c0Tensor_empty`: I=∅ gives zero after any scalar extension; I=singleton gives A.
- `c0Tensor_infinite`: The array p^n on (n,n), zero elsewhere, is included; the array constantly one on N² is excluded. Completion permits the first, while c₀ decay excludes the second.

### 0.1 Discs, locally analytic functions and their distributions

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) L ⊆ ℂ_p is a closed subfield (a finite extension of ℚ_p in applications), v_p the valuation with v_p(p) = 1, and ℓ(n) the number of base-p digits of n (ℓ(0) = 0).

**Pointwise realization on a translated closed disc** (comparison). For a ∈ L and r ∈ ℝ, let B(a,r)={x∈ℂ_p:v_p(x−a)≥r}. Use the native restricted power-series carrier at radius p^(−r) for `discAnalytic`; the new comparison realizes its coefficient family as the function φ(x)=Σ_k a_k(x−a)^k on B(a,r). This realization is injective and its Gauss valuation equals inf_(x∈B(a,r))v_p(φ(x)), with the supremum computed on ℂ_p-points rather than only L-points. Its Banach basis is (x−a)^k/p^floor(kr), orthonormal when r is integral. Under (a). The API consists of `discAnalytic_eval` (the convergent pointwise sum), `discAnalytic_eval_injective` (coefficients are determined by that function) and `gaussVal_eq_inf` (the maximum principle on the stated disc). (Source: Colmez, §I.4.1, Propositions I.4.2–I.4.3, printed pp. 13–14.)

*Needs:* the native restricted-series and Gauss-norm inputs listed in the supplier contracts; Mathlib nonarchimedean infinite sums.

**Checks.**

- `gaussVal_X`: v_{B(0,0)}(x) = 0.
- `gaussVal_restrict_le`: Restriction to B(a, r + 1) does not decrease the valuation.
- `geometric_not_closed_disc` (non-example): Σ x^k is not analytic on the closed unit disc.
- `maximum_not_L_points` (non-example): X³−X has Gauss norm 1 on the unit disc, but for every x∈ℤ₃ its norm is at most 1/3. The maximum-principle comparison therefore uses ℂ_p-points, not only the coefficient field.

**Locally analytic functions of fixed radius** (construction). For h ∈ ℕ, LA_h(ℤ_p, L) is the space of φ : ℤ_p → L whose restriction to each a + p^hℤ_p is the restriction of some φ_{a,h} ∈ An(B(a, h), L), with v_{LA_h}(φ) = inf_a v_{B(a,h)}(φ_{a,h}) (the infimum may be taken over any set of representatives of ℤ_p/p^h). It is an L-Banach space with orthonormal basis e_{h,n}(x) = 1_{n+p^hℤ_p}(x)·((x + i(n))/p^h)^{m(n)} (n = (m(n) + 1)p^h − i(n), 1 ≤ i(n) ≤ p^h), LA_h(ℤ_p, L) = L ⊗̂_{ℚ_p} LA_h(ℤ_p, ℚ_p), and the inclusions LA_h ⊂ LA_{h+1} are continuous of norm ≤ 1. Since ℤ_p is compact, every locally analytic function lies in some LA_h, and LA(ℤ_p, L) = lim→_h LA_h(ℤ_p, L) carries the locally convex inductive-limit topology. Under (a). In addition: The coefficient-extension assertion requires the completed projective tensor construction and its basis comparison (Colmez §I.1.4, Proposition I.1.8 and Corollary I.1.9, pp. 6–7); §0.0 supplies the separated completion and the c₀ coefficient-extension equivalence. Its API consists of `LAh` (LA_h(ℤ_p, L) with v_{LA_h}), `LAh_mono` (LA_h ⊂ LA_{h+1}, norm-decreasing), `locallyAnalytic_iff_exists_LAh` (φ is locally analytic iff φ ∈ LA_h for some h) and `LA` (LA(ℤ_p, L) = lim→ LA_h with the inductive-limit topology). (Source: Colmez, §I.4.2, Remark I.4.4, Lemma I.4.5, Corollary I.4.6, pp. 14–15; RJW, Definition 3.40 and the description of C^{n−an}, p. 24.)

*Needs:* §0.1 `discAnalytic`.

**Checks.**

- `indicator_mem_LAh`: 1_{a+p^hℤ_p} ∈ LA_h with valuation 0.
- `LAh_basis_orthonormal`: For h=0 the basis element indexed by n=m is x^m, with Gauss valuation 0; on the unit disc the norm of 1+p x is 1. This checks the coefficient scaling, rather than merely repeating the basis theorem.
- `indicator_not_mem_LAh_pred` (non-example): for h ≥ 1, 1_{a+p^hℤ_p} ∉ LA_{h−1}; at h = 0 there is no smaller stage and the statement is not made.

**Amice's theorem on Mahler coefficients** (theorem). For every h ∈ ℕ, the functions [n/p^h]!·C(x, n) (n ∈ ℕ) form an orthonormal basis of LA_h(ℤ_p, L). Consequently a continuous φ with Mahler coefficients a_n(φ) is locally analytic if and only if lim inf_n v_p(a_n(φ))/n > 0; if φ ∈ LA_h then lim inf v_p(a_n(φ))/n ≥ 1/((p − 1)p^h). Under (a). In addition: Mahler's theorem (the C(x, n) are an orthonormal basis of C⁰(ℤ_p, L)) is Mathlib's PadicInt.mahlerEquiv. (Source: Colmez, Theorem I.4.7 and Corollary I.4.8, p. 15.)

*Needs:* §0.1 `LAh`; Mathlib `PadicInt.mahlerEquiv`.

**The locally analytic topology is finer** (lemma). The inclusion LA(ℤ_p, L) ⊂ C⁰(ℤ_p, L) is continuous with dense image (locally constant functions are dense in C⁰), but the inductive-limit topology on LA(ℤ_p, L) is strictly finer than the topology induced from C⁰. Equality of the underlying functions is not equality of their topologies: a sequence of locally analytic functions converging uniformly need not converge in LA(ℤ_p, L). Under (a). (Source: RJW, Remark 3.41, p. 24.)

*Needs:* §0.1 `LAh`; §0.1 (Amice's theorem on Mahler coefficients).

**Locally analytic distributions** (definition). D(ℤ_p, L) is the space of continuous linear forms on LA(ℤ_p, L), i.e. of linear forms whose restriction to every LA_h is continuous. With the valuations v_{LA_h}(μ) = inf_{φ≠0}(v_p(μ(φ)) − v_{LA_h}(φ)) it is a Fréchet space, equal as a topological vector space to the projective limit lim← D_h of the Banach duals D_h = LA_h(ℤ_p, L)′. For finite L/Q_p this is also its strong dual topology, by the compact-type duality comparison in §0.3. Restricting a bounded measure to LA(ℤ_p, L) gives an injective continuous map M(ℤ_p, L) → D(ℤ_p, L), by density of LA in C⁰. Under (a). In addition: Bounded measures M(ℤ_p, L) = C⁰(ℤ_p, L)′ are PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras' objects (its L0). The strong-duality and bidual claims in this roadmap are restricted to finite L/Q_p. Over a general closed L⊆ℂ_p this definition uses only the projective-limit topology. The projective-limit topology is the topology used for the Amice theorem. Its API consists of `Dist` (D(ℤ_p, L), the continuous dual of LA(ℤ_p, L)), `valLAh` (The Fréchet valuations v_{LA_h}), `measureToDist` (M(ℤ_p, L) → D(ℤ_p, L), restriction) and `measureToDist_injective` (The restriction map is injective). (Source: RJW, Definition 3.42 and Remark 3.44, pp. 24–25; Colmez, §II.2 opening, pp. 29–30.)

*Needs:* §0.1 `LAh`; §0.1 (The locally analytic topology is finer); PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L0.

**Checks.**

- `dirac_mem`: δ_a is a distribution.
- `measureToDist_two_atoms`: At p=3 the bounded measure δ_0−δ_1 has total mass zero but takes x to −1 after restriction; the map is not determined by total mass.
- `measureToDist_clopen`: The indicator of 1+3Z_3 takes value 1 on δ_1 and 0 on δ_0 after restriction, distinguishing the two atoms even in a locally constant stage.
- `derivative_at_zero_not_measure` (non-example): φ ↦ φ′(0) is a distribution but not a measure.

**F-analytic against ℚ_p-analytic functions** (lemma). Let F/ℚ_p be finite, 𝒪 = 𝒪_F viewed both as a locally F-analytic group G and, by restriction of scalars, as a locally ℚ_p-analytic group G₀ of dimension [F : ℚ_p], and K ⊆ ℂ_p complete containing F. The inclusion C^an(G, K) ⊂ C^an(G₀, K) identifies the F-analytic functions with the closed subspace of ℚ_p-analytic f satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations (tx)f = t·(xf) for x in the Lie algebra and t ∈ F, and is a homeomorphism onto this image. Dually D(G₀, K) → D(G, K) is a surjective quotient map of Fréchet algebras. A locally ℚ_p-analytic character χ of G₀ is F-analytic exactly when dχ is F-linear. In addition: Schneider–Teitelbaum work with a commutative locally F-analytic group; only G = 𝒪_F is used here. (Source: Schneider–Teitelbaum, Introduction, p. 1, and Lemmas 1.1–1.3, pp. 3–5.)

*Needs:* §0.1 `LAh`.

### 0.2 Strict sequences and three-space properties

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

**Strict sequences and left-heart extensions** (comparison). Use the NACvx category and its left heart from §0.0. For Hausdorff outer spaces, an extension of their embedded objects is represented by a Hausdorff space and a strict short exact sequence: a closed kernel embedding followed by a surjective quotient map. Conversely each such strict sequence is exact after embedding. The same strict-sequence comparison holds in the Hausdorff category's own left heart. These two constructions are distinguished; no equivalence of their entire hearts is asserted. Under (a). (Source: Colmez–Dospinescu–Nizioł §2.1.1, pp. 7–9; Colmez–Nizioł Appendix A, pp. 58–59.)

*Needs:* §0.0 `naHeartEmbedding_exact_iff_strictExact`, `naHeartEmbedding_extensionClosed`, `haHeartEmbedding_exact_iff_strictExact`; quotient topology constructions of §0.0.

**Extensions of Banach spaces** (theorem). An exact extension in the NACvx left heart with Hausdorff outer spaces with Banach outer terms is represented by a Banach middle term. K is a complete nonarchimedean field. No splitting hypothesis is required. Under (a). (Source: Colmez–Nizioł, Appendix A, Proposition A.1, printed p. 58; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §0.2 (Strict sequences and left-heart extensions).

**The nonarchimedean Hahn–Banach theorem** (theorem). Let K be spherically complete (every nested family of closed balls has nonempty intersection), V an ultrametric normed K-vector space, U ⊆ V a subspace and ℓ : U → K a continuous linear functional. Then ℓ extends to a continuous linear functional on V of the same operator norm; consequently for every v ∉ closure(U) there is a continuous functional vanishing on U with ℓ(v) = 1, and the continuous dual separates points of V. Over a field that is not spherically complete the norm-preserving extension fails in general. A space with a chosen countable orthogonal Schauder basis still has a point-separating dual, by its coordinate functionals; this narrower observation makes no assertion about extending a functional from an arbitrary subspace. In addition: K is a field complete for a nontrivial nonarchimedean absolute value; spherical completeness is a hypothesis of the first statement and is not implied by completeness (ℂ_p is not spherically complete). (Source: Schneider, author lecture notes §9, Proposition 9.2, printed pp. 58–59, and Corollaries 9.3–9.4, printed p. 59; the coordinate-functional observation follows directly from the chosen Schauder basis. Ingleton is the historical attribution.)

*Needs:* Mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap`, `IsUltrametricDist`.

**Splitting under spherical completeness or separability** (theorem). In the preceding Banach extension a continuous K-linear section of V→V₂ exists if K is spherically complete or if both outer Banach spaces have a dense subspace of countable K-dimension. The disjunction is essential to the source statement. Under (a). (Source: Colmez–Nizioł, Appendix A, Remark A.2, printed p. 58; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §0.2 (Extensions of Banach spaces); §0.2 (the nonarchimedean Hahn–Banach theorem, stated there).

**Extensions of Fréchet spaces** (theorem). An exact left-heart extension with Fréchet outer terms is represented by a Fréchet middle term over a complete nonarchimedean K. This result makes no assertion of a continuous splitting. Under (a). (Source: Colmez–Nizioł, Appendix A, Proposition A.3, printed p. 58; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §0.2 (Strict sequences and left-heart extensions); §0.2 (Extensions of Banach spaces).

**Extensions of spaces of compact type** (theorem). An exact left-heart extension with compact-type outer terms has compact-type middle term if K is spherically complete or both outer terms are separable. Compact type means a countable inductive limit of Banach spaces with injective compact transition maps, with its locally convex limit topology. Under (a). (Source: Colmez–Nizioł, Appendix A, Proposition A.4, printed pp. 58–59; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §0.2 (Strict sequences and left-heart extensions); §0.2 (Extensions of Fréchet spaces); §0.2 (Splitting under spherical completeness or separability).

### 0.3 Polydiscs, charts and compact manifolds

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

Source for this subsection unless a target says otherwise: Schneider–Teitelbaum, §1, Lemmas 1.1–1.2 and Proposition 1.4, printed pp. 3–6; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.

**Analytic functions on finitely many polydiscs** (construction). For a finite clopen chart set S and coordinates z∈Z_p^d, the radius-h analytic stage is the finite product over S of restricted power series in normalized coordinates (z−a)/p^h. Coefficients tend to zero outside finite subsets of N^d; the norm is the maximum coefficient norm. Its coefficient model is native c₀(S×N^d,K). The chart realization, rather than a second power-series carrier, identifies this with actual functions. Under (a). Its API consists of `analyticStage` (The normalized coefficient Banach model c₀(S×N^d,K)), `analyticStage_ext` (Equality is coefficientwise equality) and `analyticStage_single` (A monomial on one chart has its specified single coefficient).

*Needs:* §0.1 `discAnalytic`; Mathlib `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.analyticStage_point` (compatibility): For S and N^0 both singleton, evaluation at the unique index is a continuous linear isometry to K.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.analyticStage_empty` (degenerate): The empty chart set gives the zero space.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.analyticStage_geometric_excluded` (non-example): The coefficient family constantly 1 in positive dimension is not a radius-h analytic stage element.

**Compact restriction to a smaller radius** (lemma). For finite p-adic charts, restriction from analytic radius h to radius h+1 is a continuous injective K-linear map and is completely continuous. After splitting into the finitely many smaller residue charts, the omitted destination Taylor coefficients of total degree≥N contribute at most C|p|^N; C depends only on the fixed normalization. Under (a).

*Needs:* §0.3 `analyticStage`; AdicSpacesPartII R3/completely-continuous-map and its finite-range approximation criterion, specialized to the coefficient field K.

**A common analytic radius on a compact manifold** (lemma). Every locally Q_p-analytic function on a compact finite-dimensional p-adic analytic manifold belongs to a finite-chart analytic stage at one common radius. Every finite family of such functions belongs to a common stage. Under (a).

*Needs:* §0.3 `analyticStage`; §0.1 `LAh`.

**Analytic stage pullback and multiplication** (construction). For analytic f:X→Y and target stage h, choose a source refinement k(f,h) on which every normalized component of f lands in the relevant closed target polydisc and has restricted coefficients of norm at most one. Finite chart substitution defines `analyticStagePullback f h : A_h(Y,K)→A_k(X,K)`, bounded by the finite chart normalization constant. Its evaluation is g(f(x)); refinements commute because both sides are the same analytic functions and restricted-series realization is injective. A fixed a∈LA(X,K) belongs to a stage h_a. On a common refinement k≥h,h_a, coefficient Cauchy product gives `analyticStageMultiplier a h : A_h(X,K)→A_k(X,K)`, with bound ‖a‖_k times the radius-transition bound. API: `analyticStagePullback_eval`, `analyticStagePullback_refine`, `analyticStagePullback_comp`, `analyticStageMultiplier_eval`, `analyticStageMultiplier_bound`, `analyticStageMultiplier_refine`. Needs: restricted multivariate substitution/Cauchy product, §0.0 limits, §0.3 common radius. Source: Schneider–Teitelbaum arXiv:math/9912073v1, §2, definition of C^an and integration, pp. 5–7; Colmez §II.4, pp. 34–37.

**Checks.**

- `stagePullback_affine`: On Z_3, f(x)=1+3x pulls y² back to 1+6x+9x², with the constant and both nonconstant coefficients retained.
- `stagePullback_point_empty`: A constant map pulls g back to g(y)·1; a map from an empty chart has zero pullback codomain. There is no map from a nonempty manifold to the empty manifold.
- `stagePullback_radius`: For the indicator of 1+3Z_3, pullback by x↦3x is zero, not the original indicator. A definition acting only on unrefined global polynomial coefficients fails.
- `stageMultiplier_polynomial`: Multiplying x by 1+x gives x+x².
- `stageMultiplier_zero_one`: Multiplying by zero gives zero and by one gives the radius inclusion.
- `stageMultiplier_clopen`: Multiplying by 1_(1+3Z_3) projects to that chart and is idempotent, whereas multiplying by x is not idempotent. This distinguishes multiplication from a scalar determined by a single chart value.

**Global analytic pullback and multiplication** (construction). `analyticPullback f` and `analyticMultiplier a` are the continuous linear maps on the locally convex inductive limits induced by the compatible stage maps. Continuity follows from `naInductiveLimit_continuous_iff`; the target radius can vary with the input stage. API: `analyticPullback_apply`, `analyticPullback_stage`, `analyticPullback_comp`, `analyticMultiplier_apply`, `analyticMultiplier_stage`, `analyticMultiplier_comp`. These are actual maps of functions, separate from a transpose of an arbitrary supplied map. Every bounded set is mapped into a bounded set, so transpose maps on strong duals are continuous over finite K/Q_p; the stage formulas also directly give projective-limit continuity without a strong-topology claim for general L.

**Checks.**

- `analyticPullback_affine`: The preceding y² computation holds in LA and commutes with each radius inclusion; identity pullback fixes every locally analytic function.
- `analyticPullback_constant`: Constant f returns g(y)·1, including the nonpolynomial locally constant g=1_(1+3Z_3).
- `analyticMultiplier_refined`: The clopen projector remains idempotent globally, while x multiplication sends x to x². An arbitrary supplied endomorphism need not satisfy either formula.

**Independence of the analytic atlas** (lemma). Two finite analytic chart systems on the same compact p-adic manifold give canonically isomorphic locally analytic spaces with the same locally convex topology. The identity on functions gives a continuous K-linear equivalence. Under (a).

*Needs:* §0.3 (Global analytic pullback and multiplication); §0.3 (A common analytic radius on a compact manifold).

**Products and completed analytic tensors** (comparison). For compact analytic X,Y and finite K/Q_p, external product gives LA(X,K)⊗̂_ι LA(Y,K)≃LA(X×Y,K). At finite-chart stages use the isometric c₀(I,K)⊗̂_π c₀(J,K)≃c₀(I×J,K) of §0.0. Rectangular stages are cofinal in product charts; compact radius transitions make their double system compact type, and the diagonal indices are cofinal. The stage-limit comparison of §0.0 then supplies precisely the inductive completed tensor in the displayed formula. API: `analyticTensor_externalProduct`, `analyticTensor_basis`, `analyticTensor_radius`, `analyticTensor_equiv`. Under (a).

*Needs:* §0.0 `c0CompletedTensor_equiv`, `analyticCompactTensor_stageLimit`; §0.3 `analyticStage`, compact radius restriction and atlas independence.

**Checks.**

- `analyticTensor_monomial`: x²⊗y³ maps to x²y³, with coefficient one at (2,3).
- `analyticTensor_point_empty`: A point factor is the identity and an empty chart factor gives zero.
- `analyticTensor_infinite`: Σ p^n x^n y^n is present at the closed unit polydisc stage but is not a finite algebraic tensor. The geometric coefficients all one are excluded at that stage.

**Strong duality for analytic compact-type spaces** (comparison). Over finite K/Q_p, LA(X,K) for compact analytic X is of compact type; its strong continuous dual is a nuclear Fréchet space identified with the projective limit of the Banach-stage duals, and the canonical strong bidual map is an isomorphism. A finite extension of Q_p is discretely valued and spherically complete, so the field hypothesis of the cited compact-type duality applies. Under (a).

### Examples

The function x on the closed unit disc has Gauss valuation 0; Σ xᵏ converges on the open disc but is not analytic on the closed one; the indicator of a + pʰℤ_p lies in `LA_h` and not in `LA_{h−1}`; the sequence pⁿ·binom(x, p^{2n}) tends to zero uniformly but not in the locally analytic topology; the derivative at zero is a locally analytic distribution that is not a bounded measure.

## Layer 1: the unbounded Amice transform and operations on distributions

This layer extends the bounded Amice transform of PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras to all locally analytic distributions on ℤ_p and develops the toolbox that the p-adic L-function constructions use: evaluation of series on the open disc, pushforward, convolution and multiplication of distributions, the Amice dictionary for point masses, convolution, multiplication by x, character twists, clopen restriction, the transpose derivative, dilation and ψ, division by the coordinate on the units, local primitives, and the two non-splitting theorems that explain why a locally analytic primitive is only determined up to a locally constant function. Proposed home: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/LocallyAnalytic` and `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/Mellin` (open-disc series).

### 1.1 The Amice transform of distributions and its toolbox

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) L ⊆ ℂ_p is a closed subfield (a finite extension of ℚ_p in applications), v_p the valuation with v_p(p) = 1, and ℓ(n) the number of base-p digits of n (ℓ(0) = 0).

**The Amice transform of distributions** (theorem). For μ ∈ D(ℤ_p, L) let A_μ(T) = ∫(1 + T)^x μ(x) = Σ_n T^n ∫C(x, n)μ ∈ L⟦T⟧. Then μ ↦ A_μ is an isomorphism of Fréchet spaces from D(ℤ_p, L) onto R⁺, the power series converging on the open unit disc v_p(T) > 0 with the valuations v_{B(0,u_h)}, u_h = 1/((p − 1)p^h). Precisely, v_{B(0,u_h)}(A_μ) ≥ v_{LA_h}(μ) ≥ v_{B(0,u_{h+1})}(A_μ) − 1. Moreover ∫(1 + z)^x μ = A_μ(z) for v_p(z) > 0, and on bounded measures A_μ is the bounded Amice (Mahler) transform, so D ⊃ M corresponds to R⁺ ⊃ 𝒪_L⟦T⟧ ⊗ L. Under (a). In addition: The bounded transform on measures is PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras' (its L2 targets, e.g. bounded-inverse-amice). (Source: Colmez, Lemma II.2.1 and Theorem II.2.2, p. 30; RJW, Theorem 3.43 and (3.12), p. 25.)

*Needs:* §0.1 `Dist`; §0.1 (Amice's theorem on Mahler coefficients); PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/bounded-inverse-amice; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/amice-dirac-natural.

**Operations on distributions** (theorem). The bounded toolbox extends continuously to D(ℤ_p, L), with the following Amice transforms (∂ = (1 + T)d/dT). Dirac masses: A_{δ_a} = (1 + T)^a, and the span of Dirac masses at natural numbers is dense. Multiplication by a locally analytic function; in particular A_{xμ} = ∂A_μ and A_{z^xμ}(T) = A_μ((1 + T)z − 1) for v_p(z − 1) > 0. Restriction to b + p^nℤ_p: A_{Res μ}(T) = p^{−n}Σ_{η∈μ_{p^n}} η^{−b}A_μ((1 + T)η − 1). Derivative (∫φ dμ = ∫φ′μ): A_{dμ} = log(1 + T)·A_μ. σ_a (a ∈ ℤ_p^×), φ and ψ: A_{σ_aμ} = A_μ((1 + T)^a − 1), A_{φμ} = A_μ((1 + T)^p − 1), A_{ψμ} = ψ(A_μ), with ψφ = id, σ_a commuting with φ and ψ, ψ(μ) = 0 iff μ is supported on ℤ_p^×, and Res_{ℤ_p^×} = 1 − φψ. Convolution: A_{λ∗μ} = A_λA_μ. Under (a). In addition: The bounded versions of these operations are PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2 (restriction, φ, ψ, weights); here they are extended by continuity along the Amice isomorphism. (Source: Colmez, §II.4.1–II.4.6, pp. 34–37.)

*Needs:* §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/phi-measure; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/psi-measure; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/amice-weight; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/amice-phi.

**Division by x, primitives and logarithmic factors** (lemma). (1) Division by x on D(ℤ_p, L) is defined only up to adding a multiple of δ₀: A_{x^{−1}μ} is a primitive of (1 + T)^{−1}A_μ. For μ supported on ℤ_p^× there is a unique x^{−1}μ supported on ℤ_p^×, without using any global function x^{−1} on ℤ_p. (2) For n ∈ ℕ, b ∈ ℤ_p and k ∈ ℤ, ∫_{b+p^nℤ_p} x^k μ = p^{−n}Σ_{η∈μ_{p^n}} η^{−b}(∂^kA_μ)(η − 1) whenever k ≥ 0, or k ≤ −1 and b ∉ p^nℤ_p. For k ≤ −1, ∂^kA_μ = ∂^{−|k|}A_μ is determined only up to a polynomial of degree ≤ |k| − 1 in log(1 + T), and the right side does not depend on this choice because log η = 0 for η ∈ μ_{p^n} and Σ_η η^{−b} = 0 for b ∉ p^nℤ_p. Under (a). In addition: The integral (bounded) unit-support division is PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/inverse-mahler-unique. (Source: Colmez, §II.4.2 (division par x), Proposition II.4.1, pp. 34–35.)

### 1.2 Series on the open disc

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) K is a finite extension of Q_p with its normalized nonarchimedean absolute value; the elementary series lemmas also hold over any complete nontrivially normed ultrametric field. (b) An open-disc series F means a native power series with ||a_n|| R^n tending to zero for every real 0<R<1. Write E(F,t) for the native FormalMultilinearSeries.ofScalarsSum of its coefficients; analytic uses require ||t||<1. No convergence claim is made at ||t||=1.

Source for this subsection unless a target says otherwise: Colmez, §II.2, Lemma II.2.1 and Theorem II.2.2 with proofs, author PDF p. 30; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.

Library inputs of this subsection, used by several of its targets: Mathlib `PowerSeries.isRestricted_iff'`.

**Open-disc series and the native analytic radius** (comparison). For an open-disc series F, the native scalar formal multilinear series ofScalars(K,coeff(F)) has radius at least 1. E(F,t) is therefore the sum of this native analytic series on ||t||<1. This is an adapter between two existing library encodings, not a second definition of summation or of analyticity. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); Mathlib `FormalMultilinearSeries.ofScalars`, `FormalMultilinearSeries.ofScalars_norm`, `FormalMultilinearSeries.le_radius_of_bound`, `FormalMultilinearSeries.ofScalars_sum_eq`.

**Summability inside the open disc** (lemma). For every open-disc series F and t∈K with ||t||<1, the series Σ_n a_n t^n is summable in K. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); Mathlib `NonarchimedeanGroup.multipliable_of_tendsto_cofinite_one`.

**Uniform geometric tails on a smaller disc** (lemma). Let 0<R<S<1, M≥0, and ||a_n||S^n≤M for every n. For ||t||≤R and N≥0, ||E(F,t)−Σ_{n<N}a_n t^n||≤M(R/S)^N. Thus truncations converge uniformly on the closed radius-R disc; this is a coefficient estimate, with no compactness assumption on that disc. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §1.2 (Summability inside the open disc).

**Analytic evaluation of an open-disc series** (theorem). For every open-disc series F, the function E(F,−):K→K is analytic at every t with ||t||<1, using Mathlib’s AnalyticOnNhd. This does not identify an arbitrary function on C_p-valued points with a rigid analytic function. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §1.2 (Open-disc series and the native analytic radius); Mathlib `FormalMultilinearSeries.analyticOnNhd`.

**Evaluation preserves products inside the disc** (lemma). For open-disc series F,H and ||t||<1, E(FH,t)=E(F,t)E(H,t). The corresponding additivity and scalar-linearity follow from summability. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §1.2 (Summability inside the open disc); Mathlib `HasSum.mul_of_nonarchimedean`.

**Evaluation commutes with an isometric coefficient extension** (lemma). For an isometric field homomorphism φ:K→K′ into a complete ultrametric field, an open-disc series F and ||t||<1, E(map(φ,F),φ(t))=φ(E(F,t)). The coefficient map is the native PowerSeries.map; no arbitrary C_p-point function or completed distribution-family object is introduced. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §1.2 (Summability inside the open disc); Mathlib `PowerSeries.map`, `PowerSeries.coeff_map`.

### 1.3 Pushforward, convolution and multiplication

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

Source for this subsection unless a target says otherwise: Colmez, §II.4, printed pp. 34–37; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.

**Pushforward of analytic distributions** (construction). For an analytic map f:X→Y of compact p-adic manifolds, define f_*μ as the transpose of the constructed `analyticPullback f`, so (f_*μ)(g)=μ(g∘f). On a target stage h its restriction is μ_(k(f,h)) composed with analyticStagePullback(f,h); compatibility of refinements makes this a projective-limit element. This is a continuous K-linear map D(X,K)→D(Y,K) for the strong dual topologies. Under (a). Its API consists of `distributionPushforward` (Transpose a continuous analytic pullback), `distributionPushforward_apply` (Evaluation is μ applied to pullback) and `distributionPushforward_comp` ((g∘f)_*=g_*∘f_*).

*Needs:* §0.3 (Global analytic pullback and multiplication); §0.3 (Strong duality for analytic compact-type spaces).

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.pushforward_identity` (compatibility): Transposing the identity returns μ.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.pushforward_zero` (degenerate): The zero distribution pushes forward to zero.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.pushforward_constant`: For constant f with value y, f_*μ=μ(1)δ_y.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.pushforward_derivative`: For f(x)=1+3x on Z_3, f_*(dδ_0)=3dδ_1. Its value on y² is 6; a value-only pushforward model loses this derivative.

**External product of distributions** (construction). `distributionExternalProduct λ μ` is the compatible product-stage functional with coefficients λ(e_i)μ(e_j), transported through the completed analytic tensor equivalence. Its API is `distributionExternalProduct_pure`, `distributionExternalProduct_radius`, `distributionExternalProduct_eval` and `distributionExternalProduct_assoc`; the last follows on dense pure tensors, then by continuous extension. The bounded product-family estimate ensures extension to each complete c₀ stage. Source: Schneider–Teitelbaum §2, Theorem 2.2, pp. 6–7; Colmez §II.4, pp. 34–37. Needs: §0.3 analytic tensors and §0.0 projective limits.

**Checks.**

- `distributionExternalProduct_atoms`: δ_x⊠δ_y=δ_(x,y).
- `distributionExternalProduct_zero`: A zero functional in either factor gives zero, including an empty-manifold factor.
- `distributionExternalProduct_derivatives`: dδ_0⊠dδ_0 takes x y to one and x² to zero. The joint-first-difference or total-mass models give the wrong functional.

**Convolution by iterated analytic evaluation** (construction). For a compact analytic group G, first construct λ⊠μ on LA(G×G) through the completed inductive tensor of §0.3: on a stage pair its coefficient values are λ_h(e_i)μ_k(e_j), a bounded family that extends to the completed projective stage tensor. The compatible stage functionals define the global product distribution. Then push it along group multiplication. Thus (λ*μ)(f)=μ(y↦λ(x↦f(xy))). This defines a distribution; it is associative with unit δ_1. For abelian G it is commutative. For additive Z_p write f(x+y). Under (a). Its API consists of `distributionConvolution` (Push forward the tensor distribution along group multiplication), `distributionConvolution_apply` (Its value is the specified iterated integral) and `distributionConvolution_assoc` (Convolution is associative).

*Needs:* §0.3 (Products and completed analytic tensors); §1.3 `distributionPushforward`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.convolution_atoms`: δ_a*δ_b=δ_ab.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.convolution_unit` (degenerate): δ_1*μ=μ.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.convolution_bounded` (compatibility): On imported bounded measures it agrees with their convolution.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.convolution_derivative`: On additive Z_3, dδ_0*dδ_0=d²δ_0 and takes x² to 2. Restricting convolution to atoms or measures misses this test.

**Multiplication by an analytic function** (construction). For g∈LA(X,K), transpose the constructed analyticMultiplier(g): on a stage h, use μ at a common refinement k≥h,h_g and the coefficient-product map. Hence (gμ)(f)=μ(gf). Multiplication is K-linear in μ, continuous for each fixed g, and satisfies (g₁g₂)μ=g₁(g₂μ). Under (a). Its API consists of `distributionMultiply` (Transpose multiplication on analytic test functions), `distributionMultiply_apply` ((gμ)(f)=μ(gf)) and `distributionMultiply_assoc` (Successive multiplications multiply their analytic factors).

*Needs:* §0.3 `analyticStage`; §0.3 (Strong duality for analytic compact-type spaces).

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.multiply_one` (degenerate): 1μ=μ.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.multiply_atom`: gδ_x=g(x)δ_x.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.multiply_derivative`: x·dδ_0=δ_0 (the positive derivative convention). Multiplication by the scalar x(0)=0 would give the wrong answer.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.multiply_bounded` (compatibility): For bounded μ and continuous g this agrees with imported bounded-measure multiplication.

### 1.4 The Amice dictionary for the standard operators

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

Source for this subsection unless a target says otherwise: Colmez, §II.4, printed pp. 34–37; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.

**Amice transform of a point mass** (lemma). For a∈Z_p, A(δ_a)=(1+T)^a, with nth coefficient binom(a,n). The power is the native continuous p-adic binomial character. Under (a).

*Needs:* §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/field-bounded-amice-isometry.

**Unbounded Amice convolution identity** (lemma). For λ,μ∈D(Z_p,K), A(λ*μ)=A(λ)A(μ). The identity is in the Fréchet algebra of functions on the open unit disc, without boundedness of coefficients. Under (a).

*Needs:* §1.3 `distributionConvolution`; §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); §1.2 (Evaluation preserves products inside the disc).

**Coordinate multiplication under Amice** (lemma). A(xμ)=(1+T)·dA(μ)/dT for any locally analytic distribution μ, with the native formal-series derivative interpreted analytically on the open disc. Under (a).

*Needs:* §1.3 `distributionMultiply`; §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions).

**Additive character twist under Amice** (lemma). If |z−1|<1, then A(z^x μ)(T)=A(μ)(z(1+T)−1). The substitution maps the open unit disc to itself; z^x is locally analytic after a sufficiently small radius choice. Under (a).

*Needs:* §1.3 `distributionMultiply`; §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); §0.3 (A common analytic radius on a compact manifold).

**Fourier formula for clopen restriction** (lemma). After extending K to contain μ_(p^n), A(1_(b+p^nZ_p)μ)(T)=p^(−n)Σ_(η^(p^n)=1)η^(−b)A(μ)(η(1+T)−1). The finite character average descends to K and is independent of the integer representative b. Under (a). (Source: Colmez, §II.4.3 and Proposition II.4.1, printed p. 35; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.3 `distributionMultiply`; §1.4 (Additive character twist under Amice).

**The transpose derivative and logarithm** (lemma). With the convention (dμ)(f)=μ(f′), A(dμ)=log(1+T)A(μ). No integration-by-parts minus sign is used. Under (a).

*Needs:* §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); §0.1 `LAh`.

**Dilation and the φ operator** (lemma). For a∈Z_p, pushforward along x↦ax sends A(μ)(T) to A(μ)((1+T)^a−1). For a=p this is φ; for a=0 it is the constant series μ(1). Under (a). (Source: Colmez, §II.4.5, printed pp. 35–36; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.3 `distributionPushforward`; §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions).

**The ψ operator and support on units** (lemma). Define ψμ by first restricting μ to pZ_p, then pushing forward under x↦x/p. Then ψφ=1, φψ is restriction to pZ_p, and μ−φψμ is restriction to Z_p^×. Thus ψμ=0 exactly when μ is supported on Z_p^×. Under (a). (Source: Colmez, §II.4.5, printed p. 36; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.4 (Dilation and the φ operator); §1.3 `distributionMultiply`; §1.3 `distributionPushforward`.

**Canonical coordinate division away from zero** (lemma). If μ is supported on Z_p^×, multiplication by x is continuously invertible on that support, with inverse μ↦x^(−1)μ. In the full space D(Z_p,K), coordinate division has ambiguity Kδ_0, as already specified by the primitive construction. Under (a).

*Needs:* §1.3 `distributionMultiply`; §1.1 (Division by x, primitives and logarithmic factors); §1.4 (The ψ operator and support on units).

### 1.5 Primitives, non-splitting and logarithmic factors

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

**Local primitives with a radius loss** (lemma). Every analytic function on a closed p-adic disc admits a primitive on each strictly smaller closed disc; every locally analytic function on compact Z_p admits a locally analytic primitive. The kernel of d/dx on LA(Z_p,K) is the locally constant functions. Under (a). (Source: Colmez, §I.5, Proposition I.5.16, printed pp. 24–25; Kohlhaase Corollary 4.3, printed p. 21; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §0.1 `discAnalytic`; §0.3 (A common analytic radius on a compact manifold).

**No continuous section of analytic differentiation** (theorem). For finite K/Q_p, the continuous surjection d/dx:LA(Z_p,K)→LA(Z_p,K), with kernel LC(Z_p,K), has no continuous K-linear right inverse. Under (a). (Source: Kohlhaase, §4, Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.3, printed pp. 20–21; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.5 (Local primitives with a radius loss); §0.3 (Strong duality for analytic compact-type spaces).

**The nonsplit logarithm sequence** (theorem). Under unbounded Amice duality, the transpose of differentiation is multiplication by t=log(1+T). The sequence 0→tR⁺→R⁺→R⁺/tR⁺→0 is strict exact and has no continuous K-linear splitting, where R⁺=O(D(0,1)^−) has its Fréchet topology. Under (a). (Source: Colmez–Nizioł, Appendix A, Remark A.6, printed p. 59; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.4 (The transpose derivative and logarithm); §1.5 (No continuous section of analytic differentiation); §0.3 (Strong duality for analytic compact-type spaces).

**Cancellation in logarithmic derivative quotients** (lemma). If ν=dμ, then A(ν)/log(1+T) extends analytically to A(μ), including every p-power torsion zero of the logarithm. General ν need not be divisible by log(1+T), so a distribution primitive is not automatic. Under (a). (Source: Colmez, §II.4, printed pp. 34–37; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.4 (The transpose derivative and logarithm); §1.2 (Evaluation preserves products inside the disc).

### Examples

The Amice transform of δ_a is (1+T)^a; the derivative transposes to multiplication by log(1+T) and multiplication by x to (1+T)·d/dT; ψ ∘ φ is the identity while φ ∘ ψ restricts to pℤ_p; the series log(1+T) has every radius below one but is not restricted at radius one; δ₀ is a bounded measure supported outside the units and x·δ₀=0, so coordinate multiplication on all distributions is not injective. The putative series Σ_{n≥0} p^{−n}δ_{p^n} does not define a distribution: its evaluation on the constant function 1 would be a divergent p-adic series.

### Dependencies

## Layer 2: admissible growth, vector order and uniqueness

This layer defines admissibility. Colmez's spaces of functions of class C^r and the distributions of order r are defined on ℤ_p by explicit norm estimates; order zero is identified with bounded measures; the Amice–Vélu–Vishik theorem extends a distribution from locally polynomial test functions of degree below the order and proves the strict degree bound is sharp. In several variables the vector order is defined by the completed tensor of one-variable C^{r_i} spaces, with rectangular growth bounds, extension and uniqueness theorems, the critical counterexample, and the adapters that turn conductor-indexed growth bounds into analytic ray-class distributions. Proposed home: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/LocallyAnalytic` and `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/AnalyticDistributions`.

### 2.1 Functions of class C^r and distributions of order r

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) L ⊆ ℂ_p is a closed subfield (a finite extension of ℚ_p in applications), v_p the valuation with v_p(p) = 1, and ℓ(n) the number of base-p digits of n (ℓ(0) = 0).

**Functions of class C^r** (definition). For r ≥ 0, φ : ℤ_p → L is of class C^r if there are φ^{(j)} (0 ≤ j ≤ [r]) with ε(x, y) = φ(x + y) − Σ_{j≤[r]} φ^{(j)}(x)y^j/j! satisfying inf_{x∈ℤ_p, y∈p^hℤ_p}(v_p(ε(x, y))) − rh → +∞. C^r(ℤ_p, L) is an L-Banach space (valuation v′_{C^r}), equivalently normed by v_{C^r}(φ) = inf_n(v_p(a_n(φ)) − rℓ(n)) on Mahler coefficients, with Banach bases p^{[rℓ(n)]}C(x, n) and the wavelet basis e_{i,k,r} (i ∈ ℕ, 0 ≤ k ≤ [r]) of locally polynomial functions of degree ≤ [r]. In particular locally polynomial functions of degree ≤ [r] are dense in C^r, LA_h ⊂ C^r with v_{C^r}(φ) ≥ v_{LA_h}(φ) − rh − C₁(r), and C⁰ is the space of continuous functions. Under (a). Its API consists of `Cr` (C^r(ℤ_p, L) with v_{C^r}), `Cr_mahler` (φ ∈ C^r iff v_p(a_n(φ)) − rℓ(n) → +∞) and `locallyPolynomial_dense_Cr` (LP^{[0,[r]]} is dense in C^r). (Source: Colmez, §I.5.1, Theorem I.5.14, Propositions I.5.13 and I.5.19, Theorem I.5.17, pp. 18–25.)

*Needs:* §0.1 (Amice's theorem on Mahler coefficients); Mathlib `PadicInt.mahlerEquiv`.

**Checks.**

- `Cr_zero_eq_continuous`: C⁰ = continuous functions.
- `Cr_mahler_iff`: At p=3 and r=1, the continuous function with Mahler coefficients a_(3^k)=3^k and all other coefficients zero fails the C¹ criterion: ℓ(3^k)=k+1 and v_3(a_(3^k))−ℓ(3^k)=−1 for every k. At r=0 these coefficients do tend to zero, so the same function is continuous.
- `digit_doubling_not_C2` (non-example): For x=Σ a_n p^n, 0≤a_n<p, set d(x)=Σ a_n p^(2n). Differences have valuation at least twice the input difference valuation, so d is C¹ with derivative zero. It is not C²: at p=3, d(3^h)/(3^h)^2=1 whereas d(2·3^h)/(2·3^h)^2=1/2. A C² Taylor coefficient at zero would have to be both limits. At p=2 the corresponding ratios for 2^h and 3·2^h are 1 and 5/9. This checks the specified digit function rather than just its name.

**Differentiation and primitives in C^r** (theorem). For r≥1, d/dx:C^r(ℤ_p,L)→C^{r−1}(ℤ_p,L) is continuous and surjective. Its kernel is the closure, in C^r, of locally constant functions; primitives are therefore unique up to this closure. Under (a). (Source: Colmez, Proposition I.5.16, printed p. 24.)

*Needs:* §2.1 `Cr` and its Mahler basis.

**Distributions of order r (admissible distributions)** (definition). For r ≥ 0, a distribution μ ∈ D(ℤ_p, L) has order r (is r-admissible, or h-admissible with h = r) if it extends continuously to C^r(ℤ_p, L); D_r(ℤ_p, L) = C^r(ℤ_p, L)′. The following are equivalent: (a) μ ∈ D_r; (b) the Amice transform A_μ = Σ b_nT^n has v_p(b_n) + rℓ(n) bounded below (A_μ ∈ R⁺_r); (c) inf_h(v_{B(0,u_h)}(A_μ) + rh) > −∞; (d) v_{D_r}(μ) = inf_n(v_{LA_n}(μ) + rn) > −∞, i.e. ‖μ‖_{LA_n} = O(p^{rn}) (on the ball of radius p^{−n}); (e) there is C with v_p(∫_{a+p^nℤ_p}((x − a)/p^n)^k μ) ≥ C − rn for all a ∈ ℤ_p, k, n. The valuations of (b)–(e) are equivalent to v′_{D_r}, and μ ↦ A_μ is an isometry (D_r, v′_{D_r}) ≅ (R⁺_r, v_r). Orders add under products of transforms and under convolution. Under (a). In addition: Pollack–Stevens' 'h-admissible' (‖μ‖_s = O(s^{−h}) as s → 0⁺, their Definition 6.1) is (d) with r = h, s = p^{−n}; ModularSymbolsPadicLFunctions L2 requests it in this form. log(1 + T) has order 1; its powers log(1 + T)^j have order j. Its API consists of `DistOrder` (D_r(ℤ_p, L) = C^r(ℤ_p, L)′ inside D(ℤ_p, L)), `mem_distOrder_iff_amice` (μ ∈ D_r iff v_p(b_n) + rℓ(n) is bounded below), `mem_distOrder_iff_growth` (μ ∈ D_r iff inf_n(v_{LA_n}(μ) + rn) > −∞ (Pollack–Stevens' h-admissibility)) and `mem_distOrder_iff_riemann` (μ ∈ D_r iff the Riemann-sum bound holds).

*Needs:* §2.1 `Cr`; §1.1 (The Amice transform of distributions); §0.1 `Dist`.

**Checks.**

- `dirac_order_zero`: δ_a has order 0.
- `log_order_one`: log(1 + T) has order exactly 1.
- `infinite_order_example` (non-example): b_{p^k} = p^{−k²} gives a distribution of no finite order.

**Order zero is bounded measures** (theorem). D₀(ℤ_p, L) = C⁰(ℤ_p, L)′ is the space of bounded measures, and its Amice transforms are exactly the bounded power series 𝒪_L⟦T⟧ ⊗ L. A measure is determined by the values μ(a + p^nℤ_p), and conversely any family μ(a + p^nℤ_p) that depends only on a mod p^n, is additive (μ(a + p^nℤ_p) = Σ_{j<p} μ(a + jp^n + p^{n+1}ℤ_p)) and bounded below in valuation defines a unique measure, with ∫φ μ = lim_n Σ_{a<p^n} φ(a)μ(a + p^nℤ_p). Under (a). In addition: Bounded measures and their integral/bounded Amice transform are PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras'; this target identifies them with the order-0 part of D.

*Needs:* §2.1 `DistOrder`; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L2/bounded-inverse-amice; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L0.

**Check.** The normalized locally constant Haar functional has masses p^(−n), satisfying subdivision additivity. At p=3 their norms are 3^n and unbounded, so additivity alone does not make it a bounded measure.

**The Amice–Vélu–Vishik extension and uniqueness theorem** (theorem). Let r ≥ 0 and N ∈ ℕ ∪ {∞} with N ≥ [r]. Let μ be a linear form on the locally polynomial functions of degree ≤ N (equivalently, compatible values ∫_{a+p^nℤ_p} x^i μ for i ≤ N) such that for some C, v_p(∫_{a+p^nℤ_p}((x − a)/p^n)^k μ) ≥ C − rn for all a ∈ ℤ_p, k ≤ N, n ∈ ℕ. Then μ extends uniquely to a distribution of order r. In particular two distributions of order r that agree on locally polynomial functions of degree ≤ N coincide when N ≥ [r], i.e. when r < N + 1. For r = N + 1 uniqueness fails: d^{N+1}δ₀ (φ ↦ φ^{(N+1)}(0)) is a nonzero distribution of order N + 1 vanishing on all locally polynomial functions of degree ≤ N. Under (a). In addition: The strict threshold r < N + 1 is the small-slope condition h < k + 1 of ModularSymbolsPadicLFunctions L2 (N = k, r = h); at critical slope h = k + 1 this theorem does not apply. The anisotropic extension uses the separate conductor bounds of §2.2. (Source: Colmez, Theorem II.3.2 and its proof, pp. 32–33; RJW, Theorem B.1 and the remarks after it, pp. 79–80.)

### 2.2 Vector order: tensor wavelets and rectangular growth

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

Source for this subsection unless a target says otherwise: Loeffler, §2.3, Definitions 2.11–2.14, Remark 2.13 and Theorem 2.15, printed pp. 4–5; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.

**Tensor wavelets and vector order** (construction). For G=Z_p^g and r_i≥0, the vector-order function space is ⊗̂_π,i C^{r_i}(Z_p,K), using the Colmez C^r spaces. Tensor products of Colmez wavelets form a Banach basis; for 0≤r_i<1 their indicator wavelets have scaling p^(Σ_i floor(r_iℓ(n_i))). The coefficient norm is the c₀ sup norm in this scaled basis. This contract uses the intended tensor construction, not Loeffler Definition 2.12’s literal cofinite oscillation formula. Under (a). Its API consists of `anisotropicFunctionSpace` (The completed projective tensor of the one-variable C^{r_i} spaces), `anisotropicFunctionSpace_pure` (Finite pure tensors map to products of their actual one-variable functions) and `anisotropicFunctionSpace_basis` (Its tensor-wavelet coefficient map is a Banach equivalence with native c₀).

*Needs:* §2.1 `Cr`; §0.3 (Products and completed analytic tensors).

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.anisotropic_order_zero` (compatibility): For r=(0,0), the tensor function space is C⁰(Z_p²,K).
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.anisotropic_empty` (degenerate): The empty tensor product is K.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.anisotropic_one_coordinate`: With r=(1/2,0), the function 1_(pZ_p)(x₂) belongs as 1⊗1_(pZ_p).

**Rectangular locally constant wavelets** (lemma). When every 0≤r_i<1, the tensor wavelets of the preceding comparison are scaled characteristic functions of rectangular p-power cosets and form a Banach basis. Locally constant functions are dense in the vector-order function space. Under (a).

*Needs:* §2.2 `anisotropicFunctionSpace`.

**Rectangular growth for a locally constant functional** (definition). For a K-linear functional μ on LC(Z_p^g,K), rectangular growth ≤r means there is C≥0 such that |μ(1_(a+∏_i p^{m_i}Z_p))|≤C·p^(Σ_i r_i m_i) for every a and every tuple m_i≥0. This is a bound on actual clopen indicators and includes finite additivity earlier from linearity. Under (a). Its API consists of `RectangularGrowth` (The displayed uniform bound on all rectangular cosets), `rectangularGrowth_mono` (Increasing each component r_i preserves the bound) and `rectangularGrowth_add` (A sum of two bounded-growth functionals has the same growth order with a larger constant).

*Needs:* §2.2 `anisotropicFunctionSpace`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.rectangularGrowth_dirac`: A point mass has growth r for every r_i≥0, with C=1.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.rectangularGrowth_zero` (degenerate): The zero functional has C=0.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.rectangularGrowth_refinement` (compatibility): A box mass equals the sum of its p children in a chosen coordinate.

**Extension of rectangular distributions** (theorem). For 0≤r_i<1, every locally constant functional with rectangular growth ≤r extends uniquely to a continuous functional on the tensor vector-order function space. Its norm is bounded in terms of the growth constant and the fixed wavelet normalization. Under (a).

*Needs:* §2.2 `RectangularGrowth`; §2.2 (Rectangular locally constant wavelets).

**Growth forced by the tensor dual norm** (lemma). A continuous functional on the tensor C^{r_i} space with every r_i<1 restricts to a locally constant functional with rectangular growth ≤r. Together with the extension theorem this characterizes the tensor dual by its box values and refinement relations. Under (a).

*Needs:* §2.2 (Rectangular locally constant wavelets); §2.2 `RectangularGrowth`.

**Compatible quasi-factor chart invariance** (lemma). For a compact abelian p-adic Lie group whose Lie algebra has a chosen direct-sum decomposition, vector growth and tensor function spaces are independent of the compatible closed subgroups with open product and of compatible analytic coordinates, up to equivalent norms. Chart changes must preserve the chosen summands. Under (a).

*Needs:* §2.2 `anisotropicFunctionSpace`; §2.2 `RectangularGrowth`; §0.3 (Independence of the analytic atlas).

**Multidegree admissibility and uniqueness** (theorem). Let N_i≥0 and 0≤r_i<N_i+1. A functional on locally polynomial functions of separate degree ≤N_i extends uniquely to the tensor C^{r_i} dual if, for each box a+p^mZ_p^g and multi-index 0≤j_i≤N_i, its unnormalized local moment obeys |μ(1_box·∏(x_i−a_i)^{j_i})|≤C·p^(Σ_i(r_i−j_i)m_i). Extra degrees above floor(r_i) satisfy this bound but are not needed for density. Under (a).

### 2.3 Uniqueness, the critical case and ray-class adapters

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

**Determination by finite characters and polynomial moments** (lemma). A tensor distribution of order r with r_i<N_i+1 is determined by all moments χ(x)∏x_i^{j_i} with finite-order χ of Z_p^g and 0≤j_i≤N_i, after a finite splitting-field coefficient extension. These functions span the locally polynomial test spaces at each finite residue level. Under (a). (Source: Loeffler, §2.3, Definitions 2.11–2.14, Remark 2.13 and Theorem 2.15, printed pp. 4–5; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §2.2 (Multidegree admissibility and uniqueness).

**Failure at a critical coordinate order** (lemma). If r_i=N_i+1 in one coordinate, the tensor functional d_i^{N_i+1}δ_0 is nonzero, continuous of that order, and annihilates all separately locally polynomial tests of degree ≤N_i in that coordinate. Thus uniqueness from that test class fails at the endpoint. Under (a). (Source: Loeffler, §2.2, Remark 2.10, printed p. 4; roadmap tensor counterexample using Colmez §II.4.4; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.4 (The transpose derivative and logarithm); §2.1 `DistOrder`; §2.2 `anisotropicFunctionSpace`.

**Isotropic and vector growth bounds differ** (comparison). The isotropic order-r norm on Z_p^g weights a multivariate locally constant wavelet by p^(floor(r·max_iℓ(n_i))); tensor vector order weights by p^(Σ_i floor(r_iℓ(n_i))). Their extension criteria use, respectively, equal-radius cosets and all rectangular cosets. They must not be identified merely by r=Σ_i r_i. Under (a). (Source: Loeffler, §2.1, Definition 2.5 and Theorem 2.9, printed pp. 2–4; §2.3, p. 5; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §2.2 `anisotropicFunctionSpace`; §2.2 `RectangularGrowth`.

**From conductor bounds to analytic ray-class distributions** (comparison). An imported ray-class distribution with conductor growth bound v(μ(class modulo ∏p^{m_p}))≥C−Σ_p e_p v(α_p)m_p gives the indicated rectangular growth on compatible p-adic Lie factors. If only the equal-radius bound 0≤r=Σ_p e_pv(α_p)<1 is established, the isotropic extension theorem applies. The arithmetic construction and finite-additivity relation remain with their existing measure/L-function owners. Under (a). (Source: Loeffler, §3.1, Definition 3.1 and Theorem 3.3, printed pp. 6–7; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §2.2 (Extension of rectangular distributions); §2.3 (Isotropic and vector growth bounds differ); PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L0.

**A positive-order distribution that is not a measure** (lemma). dδ_0 on Z_p is an order-one locally analytic distribution and is not a bounded measure. In particular positive-order family tests cannot be satisfied by a construction containing bounded measures alone. Under (a). (Source: Colmez, §II.3, Proposition II.3.1, printed p. 31; §II.4.4, printed p. 35; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §1.4 (The transpose derivative and logarithm); §2.1 `DistOrder`; §2.1 (Order zero is bounded measures).

### Examples

δ_0 has order 0; the distribution f ↦ f′(0) has order 1 and is not a measure; the digit-doubling function is C¹ but not C²; for r = (1/2, 0) on ℤ_p² the locally constant tensor 1 ⊗ 1_{pℤ_p} has finite rectangular growth although the naive joint first-difference condition fails; at a critical coordinate order the functional d_i^{N_i+1}δ_0 annihilates the prescribed polynomial class.

## Layer 3: character spaces and Mellin transforms

This layer identifies distributions on a compact abelian p-adic analytic group with analytic functions on its character space. On each finite-character component the Mellin transform of a bounded measure is a power series bounded on the open disc; arithmetic branches ω^i⟨x⟩^s and clearing factors make the meromorphic functions of pseudo-measures explicit; the distribution Mellin transform is then a Fréchet algebra isomorphism onto the functions on the open polydisc, with evaluation, multiplicativity, generator change, weight analyticity and differentiation, twists, functoriality and coefficient extension, and the comparison with the rigid and adic character spaces of AdicSpaces. Proposed home: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/Mellin` and `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/AnalyticDistributions`.

### 3.1 Component Mellin series of bounded measures

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) K is a finite extension of Q_p with its normalized nonarchimedean absolute value; the elementary series lemmas also hold over any complete nontrivially normed ultrametric field. (b) An open-disc series F means a native power series with ||a_n|| R^n tending to zero for every real 0<R<1. Write E(F,t) for the native FormalMultilinearSeries.ofScalarsSum of its coefficients; analytic uses require ||t||<1. No convergence claim is made at ||t||=1.

Source for this subsection unless a target says otherwise: RJW, Remark 3.47, pp. 25–26; §5.3, pp. 34–35 (formula immediately before Remark 5.22).

**Mellin series on a finite-character component** (construction). Let G be compact and let H:G≃Δ×Z_p be an imported character chart, Δ a finite discrete set. Let ν:Δ→K be the finite-character value function (the formula also makes sense for any ν). For a native bounded measure μ on G define F_{μ,ν,H}(T)=Σ_{n≥0} μ(g↦ν(H(g)_Δ) binom(H(g)_Z,n)) T^n. Multiplication uses K, with the native algebra map Z_p→K on binomial values. This is the Mellin series adapter on the imported component; it does not construct Δ, H, the character functor or its representing space. Under (a) and (b). Its API consists of `componentMellin` (the construction itself), `componentMellin_coeff` (The nth coefficient is μ(ν∘H_Δ times binom(H_Z,n))), `componentMellin_add` (F_{μ+η,ν,H}=F_{μ,ν,H}+F_{η,ν,H}), `componentMellin_smul` (F_{aμ,ν,H}=aF_{μ,ν,H}), `componentMellin_dirac` (F_{δ_g,ν,H}=ν(H_Δg)Σ_n binom(H_Zg,n)T^n) and `componentMellin_mass` (coeff_0 F=μ(ν∘H_Δ)).

- `ComponentMellinTests.native_amice` (compatibility): For G=Z_p, Δ a singleton, its canonical product chart and ν=1, componentMellin μ equals the native AbstractMeasure.amiceTransform μ.

**Bounded component Mellin coefficients** (lemma). Under the component-Mellin hypotheses, if C≥0 and ||ν(δ)||≤C for every δ, then ||coeff_n F_{μ,ν,H}||≤||μ||C for every n, where ||μ|| is the native continuous-linear-functional operator norm. For finite characters in a splitting field one may take C=1. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §3.1 `componentMellin`; Mathlib `PadicInt.norm_mahler_eq`.

**Bounded component series are analytic on the disc** (theorem). For every μ,ν,H as above, the component series is open-disc analytic and has uniformly bounded coefficients. It is therefore a bounded rigid function when transported to the imported component. This forward comparison does not by itself prove that every bounded rigid function comes from a measure. Under (a) and (b).

**Character evaluation equals the component Mellin value** (theorem). For ||t||<1 let κ_t:Z_p→K be the native additive character with κ_t(1)=1+t. Then E(F_{μ,ν,H},t)=μ(g↦ν(H_Δg)κ_t(H_Zg)). If H is a group chart and ν a finite character, its right side is the scalar character integral on the imported component. The statement uses continuous maps and genuine coefficient-field points. Under (a) and (b).

Library inputs of this subsection, used by several of its targets: Mathlib `PadicInt.addChar_of_value_at_one`.

**Mellin branches in an arithmetic parameter** (construction). For an open-disc series F, q∈K with ||q||<1, and s∈Z_p, put B_{F,q}(s)=E(F,κ_q(s)−1), using the native κ_q(1)=1+q. In the standard odd-prime unit chart, γ=1+p, q=γ−1, and ν=ω^i, this is Mel_{μ,i}(s)=∫ω(x)^i〈x〉^s dμ. At p=2 the imported chart is {±1}×(1+4Z_2), with γ=5; the odd-prime chart is not used there. Under (a) and (b). Its API consists of `branchMellin` (the construction itself), `branchMellin_def` (B_{F,q}(s)=E(F,κ_q(s)−1)), `branchMellin_zero` (B_{F,q}(0)=coeff_0 F), `branchMellin_one` (B_{F,q}(1)=E(F,q)) and `branchMellin_add` (B_{F+H,q}(s)=B_{F,q}(s)+B_{H,q}(s) for two open-disc series).

**Mellin evaluation at integral weights** (lemma). For n≥0, B_{F,q}(n)=E(F,(1+q)^n−1). This pins integral specialization of a branch independently of arithmetic L-value interpolation. In the canonical unit chart, recovering x^k for k≥0 additionally requires the finite character ν=ω^i with k≡i modulo p−1 for odd p, and the corresponding parity branch at p=2; the coordinate comparison is `branchMellin_powerCharacter`: the imported unit decomposition gives ω(x)^i〈x〉^k=x^k for such k, including the parity condition at p=2; composing with §3.1 character evaluation proves that this branch value is the x^k moment. No finite-character factor is omitted. Under (a) and (b).

*Needs:* §3.2 `branchMellin`; Mathlib `PadicInt.addChar_of_value_at_one_def`.

**Mellin evaluation on a clearing-factor domain** (construction). For open-disc numerator F and denominator D define Q_{F,D}(t)=E(F,t)/E(D,t) only as a meromorphic chart expression. All evaluation theorems require ||t||<1 and E(D,t)≠0. For a pseudomeasure λ imported from PMIA L3 and a genuine clearing numerator μ=([a]−[1])λ, F is the component Mellin series of μ and D represents κ_t(a)−1. A quotient’s total value at a zero denominator has no meromorphic meaning; no extension of the pseudomeasure’s value is asserted there. Under (a) and (b). Its API consists of `quotientMellin` (the construction itself), `quotientMellin_def` (Q_{F,D}(t)=E(F,t)/E(D,t); meaningful use is guarded by the nonvanishing condition), `quotientMellin_clear` (E(D,t)Q_{F,D}(t)=E(F,t) when E(D,t)≠0), `quotientMellin_one` (Q_{F,1}(t)=E(F,t)) and `quotientMellin_zero` (A zero numerator yields zero on every admissible domain).

- `QuotientMellinTests.removable_on_punctured_disc`: Q_{T,T}(t)=1 for t≠0.
- `QuotientMellinTests.trivial_character_excluded` (non-example): E(T,0)=0, so the chart domain for denominator T excludes the trivial character.

**Agreement of Mellin clearing expressions** (lemma). If F,D,F′,D′ are open-disc series with FD′=F′D, then Q_{F,D}(t)=Q_{F′,D′}(t) at every ||t||<1 for which both denominator values are nonzero. Applied to the algebraic clearing compatibility imported from PMIA L3 this proves independence on chart overlaps; it does not construct a total-fraction-ring character homomorphism. Under (a) and (b).

### 3.3 The Mellin transform of distributions

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

**Distribution Mellin components** (construction). Let G≃Δ×Z_p^d be an imported analytic group chart, Δ finite abelian, and K contain the values of its finite characters. For ν∈Δ̂ set M_ν(μ)(T)=Σ_α μ(ν(δ)·∏_i binom(z_i,α_i))T^α. This is a native multivariate series convergent on every strictly smaller closed polydisc. It is the unbounded distribution construction; the bounded scalar component is its restriction to imported measures. Under (a). Its API consists of `distributionMellin` (The coefficient formula defines the Mellin map), `distributionMellin_coeff` (Its α coefficient is the indicated locally analytic moment) and `distributionMellin_ext` (Equality of all components and coefficients implies equality of distributions).

**Mellin as a Fréchet algebra isomorphism** (theorem). For compact abelian G with an open Z_p^d subgroup, the distribution Mellin transform gives D(G,K)≃O(W_G) as topological K-algebras, with the projective-limit topology on D (equal to the strong topology for finite K/Q_p) and the closed-polydisc Fréchet topology on O(W_G). Finite character components are taken after a finite splitting extension and descended if necessary. Under (a).

**Evaluation of distributions at analytic characters** (lemma). For every locally analytic character κ:G→L^× over a finite extension L/K, evaluation of the coefficient-extended Mellin function at κ equals μ_L(κ). The character is an analytic test function on a common radius. Under (a).

*Needs:* §3.3 `distributionMellin`; §0.3 (A common analytic radius on a compact manifold).

**Multiplicativity of distribution Mellin** (lemma). For compact abelian G, M(λ*μ)(κ)=M(λ)(κ)M(μ)(κ), hence the Mellin transform sends convolution to analytic multiplication. Under (a).

*Needs:* §1.3 `distributionConvolution`; §3.3 (Evaluation of distributions at analytic characters).

**Mellin compatibility with a different generator** (lemma). In a rank-one chart with γ′=γ^u for u∈Z_p^×, the coordinate relation is t′=(1+t)^u−1 and the new component function is F′(t′)=F((1+t′)^{u^(−1)}−1). This is an adapter for the coordinate transition imported from PMIA L0a. Under (a).

**Mellin functoriality for group maps** (lemma). For an analytic homomorphism f:G→H of compact abelian p-adic groups, M(f_*μ)(κ)=M(μ)(κ∘f). The imported morphism W_H→W_G gives the corresponding pullback on analytic functions. Under (a).

Finite-dimensionality is required; this statement makes no claim for an arbitrary completed tensor with an infinite-dimensional affinoid. Under (a).

### 3.4 Geometric comparison and pseudo-measures

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

**Rigid and adic Mellin comparison** (comparison). On the character space supplied by PMIA L0a, the rigid Mellin function corresponds under the imported rigid/adic equivalence to an adic analytic section. Its restrictions on affinoid character charts agree with the radius-wise Mellin seminorms and with character evaluation at rank-one points. Under (a). (Source: BCGP II, Definition 2.2.17, printed p. 21; §§4.6.46–4.6.49, printed pp. 93–95; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

**Gluing genuine pseudomeasure Mellin numerators** (lemma). For an imported pseudomeasure λ and an actual clearing element c_g=[g]−[1], write n_g=c_gλ in the measure algebra. On the character open where κ(g)−1 is invertible, define M(λ)=M(n_g)/(κ(g)−1). The actual numerator cross-products make these local analytic quotients agree on overlaps; no evaluation homomorphism from the full total quotient ring is constructed. Under (a).

*Needs:* §3.3 (Evaluation of distributions at analytic characters); §3.2 (Agreement of Mellin clearing expressions); PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L3/cleared-numerator; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L3/cross-multiplied-numerators; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L3/independence-of-clearing-factor.

**Local pole order of a clearing presentation** (lemma). On a smooth rank-one character disc, if a genuine denominator κ(g)−1 has a zero of multiplicity m and is not identically zero, the corresponding pseudomeasure Mellin section has pole order at most m. Vanishing of the numerator can lower or remove that order. No universal simple-pole or trivial-character-only assertion is made. Under (a).

*Needs:* §3.4 (Gluing genuine pseudomeasure Mellin numerators).

### Examples

For the trivial finite character and μ = δ_u the component Mellin series is the power series of u^{s} in the disc coordinate; at the integral weight k the branch value is ∫ ω(x)^i⟨x⟩^k dμ, which is ∫x^k dμ only on the matching torsion branch (i≡k mod p−1 for odd p, and matching parity for p=2). On the trivial torsion branch at p=2, δ_{−1} has value 1 at k=1 while ∫x dδ_{−1}=−1. A genuine clearing denominator with a simple zero permits at most a simple pole, which can be removable; a clearing denominator identically zero on a component permits no quotient there; the coordinate change between the generators 1 + p and (1 + p)^u is the substitution (1 + T) ↦ (1 + T)^u.

### Dependencies

Layers 1 and 2; PadicMeasuresIwasawaAlgebras L0a (character space, universal character, generators at odd p and p = 2) and L3 (pseudo-measures and clearing); the Tau Ceti roadmap AdicSpaces, Layer 5 (gluing of adic spaces) for the geometric comparison.

## Layer 4: analytic families, Fredholm theory and finite-slope complexes

This layer supplies the operator theory. It begins with complete continuity in the Banach-algebra convention and orthonormalizable modules, constructs the Fredholm determinant det(1 − Tu) of a completely continuous operator and proves its invariance, product and base-change properties, then develops the entire-series algebra that the Riesz theory needs: entire division by linear and monic factors, resultants of monic polynomials against entire series, Hasse derivatives, the Fredholm resolvent and the Riesz projectors at a root, finite generation and projectivity of root kernels, the finite spectral transform and Coleman's truncation limits, and Gauss convergence of entire series. The second half applies this to families: affinoid-valued analytic stages and their duals, the universal-character coefficient action, compactness of contracting operators, Banach cochain complexes with compact homotopy endomorphisms, numerical slope decompositions and finite-slope perfect complexes, Fréchet presentations and the torus order on slopes. Proposed home: `TauCeti/Analysis/NonarchimedeanFredholm/*` for the operator theory and `TauCeti/NumberTheory/Padics/AnalyticDistributions` for the families and complexes.

### 4.1 Banach modules, complete continuity and orthonormalizable modules

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) The hypotheses in the statement are explicit; the index set need not be countable.

Library inputs of this subsection, used by several of its targets: Mathlib `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap`.

**Complete continuity in the Banach algebra convention** (comparison). Import the finite-range approximation predicate of AdicSpacesPartII R3 (`completely-continuous-map`). Over the stated Noetherian K-Banach algebra, compare it with Buzzard's operator-norm closure of maps whose range lies in a finitely generated A-submodule. The affine-geometric supplier states affinoid hypotheses; the precise extension of its contract to these Banach algebras is stated here as part of this target. Neither notion means finite K-rank or Mathlib IsCompactOperator. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; no orthonormal basis is required. Its API consists of `finiteImage_isCompletelyContinuous` (A continuous map whose image lies in a finitely generated A-submodule is completely continuous), `isCompletelyContinuous_comp` (Composition with a bounded A-linear map on either side preserves complete continuity), `isClosed_completelyContinuous` (Completely continuous maps form the operator-norm closure of the finite-A-image maps) and `isCompletelyContinuous_iff_containing_finite` (Over Noetherian A, the imported epsilon-approximation predicate is equivalent to the pointwise epsilon bound with range contained in a finite A-submodule). (Source: Buzzard, Section 2, pp. 9-10, finite-rank and compact definitions.)

*Needs:* AdicSpacesPartII R3; §4.1 (Finite ambient image versus finitely generated range).

**Checks.**

- `identity_on_A`: The identity of A is completely continuous as an A-linear map, including when A is infinite-dimensional over K.
- `identity_on_infinite_c0`: For nonzero A, the identity on c_A(N) is not completely continuous: every output column has norm one.
- `decaying_diagonal`: For rho in K with 0<norm(rho)<1, diag(rho^n) on c_A(N) is completely continuous, although it has infinite-dimensional K-image.

**Finite coordinate truncation** (construction). For a finite T⊆I, the existing helper π_T is the native continuous A-linear endomorphism of c_A(I) that retains coordinates in T and sets every other coordinate to zero. Write `c0Single(j,a)` for the native finitely supported family with value a at j and zero elsewhere, so e_j=`c0Single(j,1)`. Its value is the finite sum Σ_{j∈T}x_j e_j; the carrier remains the native C0 space. Under the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1, with arbitrary discrete I. Its API consists of `coordinateProjection_apply` (At coordinate j, π_T(x)_j is x_j if j∈T and zero otherwise), `coordinateProjection_norm_le` (For every x, ‖π_T x‖≤‖x‖), `coordinateProjection_empty` (π_∅=0 as a native continuous A-linear map), `coordinateProjection_inter` (π_T composed with π_S is π_(T∩S); hence each finite projection is idempotent) and `coordinateProjection_single` (π_T(a e_j)=a e_j if j∈T, and zero if j∉T). (Source: Buzzard, §2, pp.7–12 for coordinates; §3, full manuscript p.22.)

*Needs:* Mathlib `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap`, `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap.ext`, `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap.toBCF`.

**Checks.**

- `single_selected`: The j-th coordinate of `c0Single(j,a)` is a.
- `single_rejected` (non-example): Its i-th coordinate is zero when i≠j.
- `single_norm`: Its native sup norm is ‖a‖, including a=0.
- `projection_empty_support`: For every x, π_∅x=0.
- `projection_selected_coordinate`: π_{j}(a e_j)=a e_j.
- `projection_rejected_coordinate` (non-example): If i≠j, π_{i}(a e_j)=0.

**Evaluation of a finite coordinate projection** (lemma). For T finite, x∈c_A(I) and j∈I, (π_T x)_j=x_j when j∈T, and (π_T x)_j=0 otherwise. Under the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1, with arbitrary discrete I.

*Needs:* §4.1 `coordinateProjection`.

**Contractivity of coordinate truncation** (lemma). For every finite T⊆I and every x∈c_A(I), ‖π_T x‖≤‖x‖. Under the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1, with arbitrary discrete I.

*Needs:* §4.1 `coordinateProjection_apply`.

**Bounded-family extension from c0** (construction). A bounded family (m_i) in a Banach A-module M determines the unique continuous A-linear map c_A(I)->M sending e_i to m_i, by x |-> sum_i x_i m_i. Under the normalized module norm its operator norm is sup_i norm(m_i). In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; I arbitrary discrete; the A-action has norm(a m)<=norm(a) norm(m). Its API consists of `c0Lift_apply` (The value on x is the unconditional sum of x_i m_i), `c0Lift_single` (c0Lift(m)(e_i)=m_i) and `c0Lift_unique` (Any continuous A-linear map with these basis values equals c0Lift(m)). (Source: Buzzard, Section 2, pp. 7-9.)

*Needs:* §4.1 `coordinateProjection_apply`; §4.1 `coordinateProjection_norm_le`; Mathlib `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap.ext`, `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap.instCompleteSpace`, `NonarchimedeanGroup.multipliable_iff_tendsto_cofinite_one`.

**Checks.**

- `zero_family`: The zero family extends to the zero map.
- `basis_family`: The family e_i in c_A(I) extends to the identity.
- `unbounded_family`: For 0<norm(rho)<1, the family rho^(-i) in K cannot be the basis images of a continuous map c_K(N)->K.

**Operator bound from the coordinate vectors** (lemma). For a continuous A-linear f:c_A(I)→c_A(I) and C≥0, ‖f‖_K≤C if and only if ‖f(e_i)‖≤C for every i∈I. Under the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1, with arbitrary discrete I. (Source: Buzzard, §2, printed pp. 8–9.)

*Needs:* §4.1 `c0Lift_apply`; §4.1 (Bounded coefficient action on c0); Mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.le_opNorm`.

**Orthonormalizable and potentially orthonormalizable modules** (definition). A chosen orthonormalization is an A-linear isometry M≃c_A(I); its potential version is a continuous A-linear equivalence with continuous inverse. The latter is equivalent to choosing an equivalent ONable norm. Use the existing C0 carrier, not a new space of sequences. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; arbitrary discrete I. Its API consists of `orthonormalization_coordinates` (Coordinates identify M with existing c_A(I) and reconstruct elements by unconditional summation), `potentiallyON_iff_equivalentNorm` (Potential ONability is ONability after a two-sided bounded change of norm), `coordinateProjection_norm_le` (Finite coordinate projections have norm at most one in an ON chart) and `c0ContinuousSMul` (The existing pointwise action of the normed ring A on C0(I,A) is jointly continuous, using c0-scalar-bound). (Source: Buzzard, Section 2, pp. 7-9 and 15-16.)

*Needs:* §4.1 `c0Lift_apply`; §4.1 (Bounded coefficient action on c0); §4.1 `coordinateProjection_norm_le`.

**Checks.**

- `empty_basis`: The empty index set gives the zero module.
- `finite_basis`: For finite I this agrees with A^I with its max norm.
- `potential_not_isometric`: Let M be a normed K-line with an algebraic coordinate e:M to K and norm(x)=c norm(e(x)), where c>0 is outside the value group of K. Then M is potentially ONable, but there is no K-linear isometry M to K. This tests an actual normed module with the specified rescaling law; it does not assume non-isometry.

**Canonical topology on finite Banach modules** (lemma). For a finite A-module equipped with a Banach A-module topology, the topology is the canonical quotient topology from any finite presentation; submodules are closed and A-linear maps between finite Banach modules are continuous. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; finiteness over A and the precise Noetherian hypotheses are retained. (Source: Buzzard, Proposition 2.1 and proof; Lemma 2.3(b), pp. 6-11.)

*Needs:* Mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.isOpenMap`.

**Finite coordinate topology on a finite submodule** (lemma). For a finitely generated submodule Q of c_A(I), some finite coordinate projection pi_T is injective on Q and satisfies norm(q)<=C norm(pi_T q) for all q in Q and some C>0. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; Q finite over A, not assumed free. (Source: Buzzard, Lemma 2.3(a)-(b), pp. 10-11.)

*Needs:* §4.1 (Canonical topology on finite Banach modules); §4.1 `orthonormalization_coordinates`; §4.1 (Finite coordinates detect a finite submodule); Mathlib `Submodule.FG.map`.

**Uniform coordinate truncation on finite submodules** (lemma). For Q finite over A inside c_A(I) and epsilon>0, some finite T satisfies norm(q-pi_T q)<=epsilon norm(q) for every q in Q. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; Q need not be free. (Source: Buzzard, Lemma 2.3(c), pp. 10-11.)

*Needs:* §4.1 `orthonormalization_coordinates`; §4.1 (Finite coordinate topology on a finite submodule); Mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.exists_preimage_norm_le`.

**Completely continuous matrix criterion** (theorem). A continuous A-linear u:c_A(I)->c_A(J) is completely continuous exactly when r_j(u)=sup_i norm(a_ij) tends to zero outside finite subsets of J; then pi_T u converges to u in operator norm. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; i indexes inputs and j outputs. (Source: Buzzard, Proposition 2.4, pp. 11-12.)

*Needs:* §4.1 `finiteImage_isCompletelyContinuous`; §4.1 (Uniform coordinate truncation on finite submodules); §4.1 `coordinateProjection_apply`; §4.1 `coordinateProjection_norm_le`.

**Finite ambient image versus finitely generated range** (comparison). For a continuous A-linear map f:M to N over a Noetherian commutative ring A, its range is contained in a finitely generated A-submodule if and only if its range is itself finitely generated. This compares Buzzard's finite-rank convention with the range convention used by AdicSpacesPartII R3 (`completely-continuous-map`); it does not assert the equivalence over non-Noetherian A. Under (a). (Source: Buzzard, Section 2, p. 9, finite-rank definition.)

*Needs:* Mathlib `Submodule.FG.of_le`.

**Strict norm approximation by finite-image maps** (lemma). For Banach modules M,N over the stated Noetherian K-Banach algebra A and a continuous A-linear f, imported complete continuity is equivalent to: for every epsilon>0 there is a continuous A-linear g whose range is contained in a finite A-submodule and whose difference from f, restricted to K, has operator norm strictly less than epsilon. Under (a). (Source: Buzzard, Section 2, pp. 8-10, operator norm and closure definition.)

*Needs:* §4.1 `finiteImage_isCompletelyContinuous`; §4.1 (Finite ambient image versus finitely generated range); Mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm_le_bound`, `ContinuousLinearMap.le_opNorm`, `Metric.mem_closure_iff`.

**Checks.**

- `approximation_zero_radius_boundary` (non-example): For any f there is no g with norm(f-g)<0.

**Bounded coefficient action on c0** (lemma). For a normed commutative ring A and any topological space I, the existing pointwise A-action on C0(I,A) satisfies norm(a x)<=norm(a) norm(x). Consequently it is jointly continuous for the existing sup-norm topology. On discrete I this supplies the coefficient action of c_A(I); no new sequence carrier is constructed. Under (a). (Source: Buzzard, Section 2, pp. 7-8, definition of c_A(I).)

*Needs:* Mathlib `BoundedContinuousFunction.norm_coe_le_norm`, `BoundedContinuousFunction.norm_le`, `IsBoundedSMul.of_norm_smul_le`, `IsBoundedSMul`.

**Checks.**

- `scalar_empty` (degenerate): On C0(empty,A), norm(a x)=0.
- `scalar_single`: Multiplication by a sends the coordinate vector with value b at i to the coordinate vector with value ab at i.

**Finite coordinates detect a finite submodule** (lemma). Let B be a commutative Noetherian ring, I any set and Q a finitely generated B-submodule of the full product B^I. There is a finite S contained in I such that two elements of Q agreeing on S agree everywhere. No Banach topology, field, domain or freeness of Q is required. Under (a). (Source: Buzzard, Lemma 2.3(a), p. 10, complete proof paragraph.)

*Needs:* Mathlib `Submodule.fg_iff_exists_fin_generating_family`, `isNoetherian_pi`, `IsNoetherian`, `Submodule.fg_span_iff_fg_span_finset_subset`.

**Checks.**

- `coordinate_empty_submodule` (degenerate): Two elements of the zero submodule of B^I are equal without inspecting any coordinates.
- `coordinate_product_ring` (compatibility): In the submodule of (K times K)^N generated by the constant vector (1,0), vanishing of coordinate zero forces the vector to vanish.
- `coordinate_single_omitted` (non-example): If j is outside finite S and A is nonzero, the coordinate vector e_j vanishes on S but is nonzero.

**Complete continuity of the identity detects finite generation** (theorem). For a Banach A-module M in the standing setting, the identity is completely continuous if and only if M is finitely generated over A. Neither potential ONability nor property (Pr), freeness, finite K-dimension or constant rank is required. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; no ONability or (Pr) is needed for this implication. (Source: Buzzard, Proposition 3.2, p. 23, finite-generation paragraph.)

**Checks.**

- `finite_identity_zero` (degenerate): The identity on A^0 is completely continuous.
- `finite_identity_finite` (compatibility): Every continuous A-linear endomorphism of a finitely generated A-module is completely continuous.
- `finite_identity_infinite` (non-example): If M is not finitely generated over A, its identity is not completely continuous.

### 4.2 Fredholm determinants on orthonormalizable and (Pr) modules

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1.

**Fredholm determinant in an orthonormal chart** (construction). For completely continuous u on c_A(I), construct the formal power series P_u with c_0=1 and c_n=(-1)^n sum_{S subset I, card S=n} det(a_ij)_{i,j in S}. Entireness and chart independence are the separately named ensuing theorems. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1 and complete continuity. Its API consists of `fredholmSeries_coeff` (The n-th coefficient is the signed principal-minor sum), `fredholmSeries_constant` (The constant coefficient is one) and `fredholmSeries_isEntire` (The minor-tail-estimate proves decay at every positive real radius). (Source: Buzzard, Definition following Proposition 2.4, p. 12.)

*Needs:* §4.1 (Completely continuous matrix criterion); §4.2 `fixed_degree_minors_null`.

**Checks.**

- `zero_operator`: P_0=1.
- `rank_one_scalar`: For multiplication by a on A, P_u=1-aT.
- `nonzero_nilpotent`: For the nonzero two-by-two nilpotent Jordan block, P_u=1; determinant one does not mean u=0.

**Entire power series over A** (definition). Define A{{T}} as the subring of A[[T]] consisting of c with norm(c_n) R^n->0 for every real R>0. Give its family of Gauss seminorms and evaluation at any a in A; evaluation is continuous for every radius R>=norm(a), R>0. In addition: A is a complete commutative ultrametric normed ring; its norm is submultiplicative. Its API consists of `mem_entireSeries` (Membership is coefficient decay at every positive radius), `entire_eval` (Evaluation at a is a ring homomorphism given by the convergent coefficient sum) and `entire_eval_bound` (norm(eval_a(c))<=sup_n norm(c_n) R^n for R>=norm(a), R>0). (Source: Buzzard, Section 3, p. 21.)

*Needs:* Mathlib `HasSum.mul_of_nonarchimedean`.

**Checks.**

- `polynomials_are_entire`: Every polynomial is entire, including constants.
- `superexponential_coefficients`: For 0<norm(rho)<1, coefficients rho^(n*n) define an entire series.
- `geometric_nonexample`: The series with every coefficient one is not entire, even though it converges on the open unit disc.

**Uniform entire tail bound from column majorants** (lemma). Suppose a family of completely continuous matrices has output-column norms bounded by one bounded cofinite-null family b_j>=0. Fix R>0 and 0<q<1, choose finite T with R b_j<=q outside T, m=card T and B=max(1,R sup_j b_j). Uniformly throughout the family, norm(c_n) R^n<=B^m q^max(n-m,0). In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; coefficients c_n use the signed principal-minor construction.

If u_s->u in operator norm and their matrices, including u, share a bounded cofinite-null column majorant, then for every R>0, sup_n norm(c_n(u_s)-c_n(u)) R^n->0. In particular P_{u_s}(1)->P_u(1).

*Needs:* §4.2 (Lipschitz bound in each determinant degree); §4.2 (Uniform entire tail bound from column majorants).

**Determinant of a finite-coordinate operator** (comparison).

In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; S is finite. (Source: Buzzard, Lemma 2.5(b), pp. 12-13.)

A Banach A-module M has (Pr) when it is a continuous direct summand of a potentially ONable module; equivalently there are continuous A-linear i:M->c_A(I), r:c_A(I)->M with ri=1. The lifting characterization is a theorem, not a defining bundle of assumptions. Under (a).

**Continuous lifting characterization of (Pr)** (theorem). A Banach A-module has (Pr) exactly when every continuous A-linear map from it lifts through every surjective continuous A-linear map of Banach A-modules.

**Uniform finite determinant perturbation** (lemma). Let D,E be square matrices on a finite type J, C≥1 and δ≥0. If every entry of D and E has norm at most C and every corresponding difference has norm at most δ, then norm(det D−det E)≤δ C^max(card J−1,0).

For every n≥0 the family det(a_ij) indexed by the finite subsets S of I with card S=n tends to zero along the cofinite filter on that family of subsets. In addition: A is a normed commutative ring with norm(1)=1 and an ultrametric norm. I need not be countable. Completeness is needed only when the ensuing construction invokes unconditional summability. (Source: Buzzard, Definition following Proposition 2.4, manuscript p. 12.)

**Finite exceptional-set product estimate** (lemma). Let S,T be finite subsets of an arbitrary set I. Let b:I→R satisfy 0≤b_j≤B with B≥1, and suppose b_j≤q outside T where 0≤q≤1. Then product_{j in S} b_j≤B^card(T) q^max(card(S)−card(T),0). In addition: The coefficient family in this lemma is real and nonnegative. It need not tend to zero; this is a finite product statement, valid also at q=0 and q=1. (Source: Serre, Proposition 7(b), printed p. 76 (PDF p. 9).)

### 4.3 Entire division by linear and monic factors

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) A is a complete commutative normed ring with submultiplicative norm and norm(1)=1. The named series is entire when explicitly required; a is any element of A. No field, reducedness, Noetherianity or small-norm condition on a is assumed. (b) A is a nontrivial complete commutative ultrametric normed ring with submultiplicative norm and norm(1)=1. Native PowerSeries and Polynomial carriers are used. Q is monic of degree d, allowing d=0 and Q=1. Write B_Q for native invOfUnit(Q.reverse,1), using the native polynomial inclusion, and b_k for its kth coefficient. The reversal has constant coefficient 1. No domain, reducedness, Noetherianity, field or splitting hypothesis is imposed. (c) C is a real number with C≥1 and norm(coeff_i(Q.reverse))≤C^i for every i. Such a C exists because the reversal is a polynomial with constant coefficient 1: choose C≥1 bounding its finitely many nonconstant coefficient norms.

### 4.5 Formal resolvent recurrence and Hasse derivatives

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; M has (Pr) and u is completely continuous. (b) Use the norm after restriction to K. The compatible A-action has an explicit bound norm(bx) <= C norm(b) norm(x) for some C>0; C is not assumed to be one. (c) the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; M has (Pr), u is completely continuous; use the actual Fredholm series and evaluated Hasse resolvent. (d) The A-action has a bound norm(bx) <= C norm(b) norm(x), with C>0. For a in A, h>=0, all Hasse values Delta_s P_u(a) vanish for s<h, and c=Delta_h P_u(a) is a unit of A.

In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; M is potentially ONable or has (Pr), using zero extension in the second case. Its API consists of `resolventCoeff_zero` (The initial coefficient v₀ is the identity endomorphism on the actual module M), `resolventCoeff_succ` (v_(n+1)=c_(n+1) 1+u v_n, with v_0=1), `resolvent_identity` (Both left and right multiplication by 1-Tu give P_u(T) times the identity).

For any possibly noncommutative semiring B and s in N, construct the additive B-linear operation Delta_s on the existing B[[T]] by coefficient_n(Delta_s f)=choose(n+s,s) times coefficient_(n+s)(f). Multiplication by the natural number means repeated addition, with no inverse factorial and no convergence assumption. In addition: B is a semiring; s and coefficient indices are natural numbers. The variable T is central. Its API consists of `hasseSeries_coeff` (Coefficient n is choose(n+s,s) times coefficient n+s), `hasseSeries_zero` (Delta_0 f=f), `hasseSeries_add` (Delta_s(f+g)=Delta_s f+Delta_s g) and `hasseSeries_smul` (Delta_s(b f)=b Delta_s f, including noncommutative B).

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) K is a complete nontrivially valued nonarchimedean field and A is a nonzero commutative Noetherian K-Banach algebra with norm one for 1 and its normalized submultiplicative ultrametric norm. All module structures are compatible. (b) I is an arbitrary discrete set and c_A(I) is the existing C0(I,A), with its supremum norm. The matrix entry u_ij is coordinate j of u(e_i): inputs come first and outputs second. Operator norms mean the native K-operator norm after restriction of scalars. (c) V is any sequence of native continuous A-linear endomorphisms with V₀=I and V_(n+1)=c_(n+1)(u)I+uV_n, where c_n(u) are the actual Fredholm coefficients.

All maps are native continuous A-linear maps. (b) Write v=1−a u, N=ker(v^h), B=a Σ_{0≤j<h}v^j, and i:N→M for the native inclusion. The exponent h is any natural number, including zero. No unit hypothesis on a is imposed. (c) F is an A-submodule with the native topological-complement relation between N and F. Let π:M→N be Submodule.projectionOntoL along F, and put l=πB.

I is a finite index type and N is its cardinality. Matrices are native square matrices on I. Write χ_M for the native characteristic polynomial and P_M for native Matrix.charpolyRev, namely det(1−TM). The polynomial functional calculus B(M) is native algebra evaluation; D_(N,m) is the bounded spectral resultant of §4.9. (b) I has a linear order, and M is upper triangular. (c) For natural numbers N,m put C_m=ℤ[b₀,…,b_m] and U_(N,m)=C_m[xᵢⱼ: i,j∈Fin N], both native multivariate polynomial rings. Write G for native Matrix.mvPolynomialX over C_m, so Gᵢⱼ=xᵢⱼ. Coefficient variables b_i and matrix-entry variables xᵢⱼ are distinct. P_M(T)=det(1−TM) is native Matrix.charpolyRev.

### 4.11 Reciprocal resultants and truncation limits

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) R is any commutative ring. The natural numbers m,n are explicit bounds for native Sylvester matrices and resultants; they are not silently replaced by actual degrees. A reflection is the native reflect at its specified exponent. Unless explicitly required, no degree, normalization, domain or nontriviality assumption is imposed. (b) A is a nontrivial complete normed commutative ring, with norm(1)=1 and ‖a+b‖≤max(‖a‖,‖b‖). Q is a monic native polynomial, d=Q.natDegree (including Q=1,d=0), and F is an existing entire power series: its weighted coefficients tend to zero at every positive radius. No field, splitting, reducedness or Noetherian hypothesis is used. (c) Write F_n=PowerSeries.trunc(n+1,F), so coefficients through degree n are retained. S_Q(F) is the preceding entireMonicQuotient, and R_Q(F)=trunc_d(F−Q S_Q(F)) is its existing native polynomial remainder. Write Res(Q,F) for the preceding entireResultant, defined by the native finite-algebra norm.

For k>N the coefficient is zero; at k=0 the empty product is one. This is a universal symmetric-polynomial estimate, valid over nonreduced A with a submultiplicative norm. Prove it first in the ring of integer symmetric polynomials: the kth elementary function of B(x_i) has monomials involving k distinct variables with positive exponents; straighten these into elementary symmetric functions, using the Newton-weight dominance bound ‖c_j‖≤ρ_1...ρ_j. Integer coefficients have norm at most one. Each weighted monomial is bounded by ∏_(i≤k)β_i. Specialize the resulting polynomial identities into A. Do not split P into roots over A or assume its norm multiplicative. Define `spectralFunctionalMajorant B r=sup_(m≥1)‖b_m‖r^m` at r>0. API: `entireCharacteristic_majorant`, `spectralFunctionalMajorant_nonneg`, `entireFunctional_majorant` (coefficient bound, monotonicity along decreasing radii and convergence to zero), `spectralTruncation_coeff_bound`. Source: Coleman, definition of D on published p. 435 and Lemma A3.8; the explicit majorant proof and bound are a derived prerequisite for his simultaneous limiting construction.

*Needs:* §4.9 finite transform and chosen-rank padding; §4.10 universal symmetric-polynomial determinant identity; §4.12 entire coefficient decay.

**Checks.**

- `spectralMajorant_coordinate`: For B=T and r>0 the functional majorant is r, fixing the absence of a constant term in its definition.
- `spectralMajorant_zero`: For B=0 the majorant is zero at every positive radius and all β_i vanish.
- `spectralMajorant_square`: For B=T² it is r², distinguishing the functional exponent from the characteristic-coefficient index.

**Uniform all-radius tails** (lemma). Fix R>0 and 0<q<1. Choose H with Rβ_i≤q for i>H and L≥β_1. Uniformly in N,M,k,

‖coeff_k D_(N,M)(B_M,P_N)‖R^k ≤ max(1,RL)^H q^(max(k−H,0)).

The right side tends to zero independently of the unbounded characteristic rank N. In particular all these outputs have uniformly small tails in G_R. API: `spectralTruncation_uniform_tail`. This estimate, rather than bounded-degree convergence, is the necessary input at the entire-characteristic endpoint.

*Needs:* §4.13 `spectralTruncation_coeff_bound`; the elementary product bound separating the first H factors from the tail.

**Coefficient stabilization and functional tails** (lemma). With b_0=0 and polynomial B_M of degree at most M, coeff_k D_(N,M)(B_M,P_N) depends only on c_1,...,c_(kM) once N≥kM (and on b_1,...,b_M). This follows from its universal symmetric expression of total root-degree at most kM. For fixed k, replacing B by B_M produces a coefficient error tending to zero uniformly in N: apply the same weighted expression bound with at least one functional tail factor, bounded by η_M=sup_(m>M)‖b_m‖ρ_1^m→0, and the remaining k−1 factors bounded by max(1,β_1)^(k−1). The finite integer straightening coefficients introduce no larger norm. Thus the double family of each coefficient is Cauchy. API: `spectralTruncation_characteristic_stable`, `spectralTruncation_functional_tail`, `spectralTruncation_coeff_cauchy`. For k=0 the error is zero. The hypotheses b_0=0 and N≥kM must appear on the stabilization theorem.

*Needs:* §4.13 Newton majorants; §4.9 padding stability; §4.10 universal polynomial identity.

**Full entire spectral transform** (construction). For entire B,P with B(0)=0 and P(0)=1, `entireSpectralTransform B P` is the unique entire native series whose coefficients are the limits of the double truncation family above. Complete coefficients and the uniform tail bound give existence in every Gauss norm, using §4.12's all-radius completeness lemma. For any two sequences N_j,M_j tending independently to infinity,

G_R(D_(N_j,M_j)(B_(M_j),P_(N_j))−D(B,P))→0  for every R>0.

This includes N_j=M_j=j; N_j need not exceed jM_j since the functional-tail estimate first fixes a finite M and then lets N grow. Changing truncation order or using any Gauss-convergent polynomial approximants with zero/one constant coefficients gives the same limit. For the latter comparison construct a common Newton majorant from uniform all-radius coefficient tails; finite initial exceptions are absorbed into ρ. API: `entireSpectralTransform_entire`, `entireSpectralTransform_constantCoeff`, `entireSpectralTransform_truncation`, `entireSpectralTransform_independent`, `entireSpectralTransform_continuous` on normalized all-radius convergent sequences, `entireSpectralTransform_polynomial` (agreement with E_n when P is polynomial and n≥deg P), and `entireSpectralTransform_mul` (D(B,PQ)=D(B,P)D(B,Q)). Polynomial factor products and Gauss multiplication give the last identity. This is Coleman’s D(B,P) of Appendix A3, p. 435, with the topology and limiting estimates made explicit.

*Needs:* all three preceding lemmas; §4.12 Gauss completeness and multiplication; §4.13 fixed-rank comparison. No bounded-degree hypothesis occurs on P.

**Checks.**

- `EntireSpectralTests.identity`: D(T,P)=P for every entire normalized P, including P=Σ_(n≥0)p^(n²)T^n over Q_p. Its constant is one, every coefficient is nonzero and quadratic decay gives convergence in every Gauss norm with unbounded truncation ranks.
- `EntireSpectralTests.zero`: D(0,P)=1 and D(B,1)=1 when B(0)=0. The characteristic rank is allowed to grow despite vanished top coefficients.
- `EntireSpectralTests.nilpotent`: For ε²=0, D(T,1−εT²)=1−εT². Nilpotents survive both limits; a root-only or reduced model loses this term.
- `EntireSpectralTests.nonzero_constant` (non-example): With P=1 and B=c≠0, the rank-N truncation yields (1−cT)^N. Its linear coefficients −Nc are not Cauchy along all integers over Q_p (successive differences have norm |c|). B(0)=0 is essential.
- `EntireSpectralTests.wrong_topology` (non-example): T^N tends coefficientwise to zero but has G_1=1. Such coefficientwise reasoning cannot replace the uniform tail theorem.

**Entire operator evaluation** (construction). For an entire B and a continuous A-linear operator u on a Banach A-module with bounded compatible A-action, define `entireOperatorEval B u=Σ_(m≥0)b_m u^m`, converging in the native K-operator norm. If u is completely continuous and b_0=0, this is completely continuous: every positive power lies in the closed complete-continuity ideal, and its polynomial partial sums converge. API: `entireOperatorEval_hasSum`, `entireOperatorEval_polynomial`, `entireOperatorEval_continuous`, `entireOperatorEval_completelyContinuous`. The scalar-action constant is explicit and need not be one. Source: Coleman, Theorem A3.9, pp. 435–436.

**Checks.**

- `entireOperator_zero`: B=0 evaluates to zero; B=T evaluates to u.
- `entireOperator_nilpotent`: If u²=0, B(u)=b_0 I+b_1 u; all higher coefficients vanish even if B has infinite degree.
- `entireOperator_constant` (non-example): On infinite c₀, B=1 evaluates to the identity, which is not completely continuous. The zero-constant hypothesis cannot be dropped from that conclusion.

**Infinite Coleman spectral mapping** (theorem). For completely continuous u on an ONable or (Pr) A-Banach module, and entire B with B(0)=0,

P_(B(u))=entireSpectralTransform(B,P_u)

as entire series in every Gauss norm. Take finite-coordinate approximants u_J→u. Their Fredholm series have a common Newton majorant from the output-column bounds of §4.2. Apply finite spectral mapping to polynomial functional truncations; pass first to entire B and then to the directed finite-coordinate limit, using the normalized all-radius continuity just proved. Operator evaluation and Fredholm continuity identify the left limit. For (Pr), extend u by zero in the chosen ONable ambient module; B(0)=0 ensures B(u⊕0)=B(u)⊕0, so splitting independence applies. This is Coleman Theorem A3.9, pp. 435–436; no reducedness or eigenvalue splitting is added. API: `fredholmSeries_entireOperatorEval`, `fredholmSeriesPr_entireOperatorEval`, `entireSpectralTransform_reciprocalResultant` (D(1−Q*,P)(1)=Res(Q,P) for monic Q, Q* the degree-correct reciprocal, so (1−Q*)(0)=0).

*Needs:* §4.1 complete-continuity ideal; §4.2 Fredholm continuity and splitting; §4.10 finite spectral mapping; §4.12 Gauss evaluation; full transform and operator evaluation above. The reciprocal comparison follows from §4.11's polynomial resultant limit and Gauss convergence at radius one; it feeds the later polynomial invertibility criterion.

### 4.14 Polynomial invertibility and finite projective spectral summands

Use Convention 1's Banach/(Pr) hypotheses, monic polynomials and degree-correct reciprocals. The entire Coleman transform and root-kernel projectivity have now been constructed. Sources: Buzzard Lemma 3.1, Proposition 3.2 and Theorem 3.3, pp. 21–25; Coleman Appendix A3–A4, pp. 435–436.

**Polynomial Fredholm invertibility criterion** (theorem). For a monic polynomial Q and completely continuous u on a (Pr) module, Q and P_u are coprime in A{{T}} exactly when Q*(u) is invertible in the algebra of continuous A-linear endomorphisms. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; Q* is the degree-correct reciprocal polynomial. (Source: Buzzard, Lemma 3.1, pp. 21-22; Coleman, Lemma A4.1 proof and Lemmas A3.7-A3.8, Theorem A3.9.)

**Riesz projectors at a Fredholm root** (theorem). If a in A is a root of P_u of Hasse order h, with the h-th Hasse derivative a unit, then M=N plus F as closed u-stable summands, (1-au)^h is zero on N, 1-au is invertible on F, and N is finite projective of constant rank h. For h>0, a is a unit and P_(u|N)=(1-a^(-1)T)^h. The projectors lie in the operator-norm closure of A[u]. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; M has (Pr); u completely continuous. For h=0 take N=0 and F=M.

**Finite projective slope summands** (theorem). Suppose P_u=Q S, Q polynomial with constant coefficient one and unit leading coefficient, S entire with S(0)=1, and Q,S analytically coprime. Then M=N plus F as closed u-stable summands, N finite projective of rank deg Q, Q*(u) kills N and is invertible on F, and P_(u|N)=Q. The associated projector lies in the closure of A[u]. In addition: the standing Banach hypotheses of Convention 1; M has (Pr); u completely continuous. The degree-zero factor gives N=0. (Source: Buzzard, Theorem 3.3 and proof, pp. 24-25.)

### 4.15 Affinoid families, coefficient actions and compactness

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

Source for this subsection unless a target says otherwise: Urban, Lemmas 3.4.6–3.4.7 and Definition 3.4.10, author pp. 43–45; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.

**Affinoid-valued analytic stages** (construction). For a complete affinoid K-algebra A with a chosen submultiplicative Banach norm, define the normalized finite-chart analytic stage A_h(X,A) by c₀(S×N^d,A), realized as restricted analytic functions in the chart coordinates. This is an orthonormalizable Banach A-module; its natural integral lattice consists of coefficient families in the norm unit ball A₀. Under (a). Its API consists of `affinoidAnalyticStage` (The native c₀ coefficient module over A), `affinoidAnalyticStage_ext` (Coefficient equality determines a section) and `affinoidAnalyticStage_integral` (The chosen lattice is exactly the norm≤1 coefficient families).

*Needs:* §0.3 `analyticStage`; §4.1 `orthonormalization_coordinates`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.affinoidStage_scalar` (compatibility): A=K recovers the scalar coefficient stage.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.affinoidStage_point`: The singleton coefficient index gives A.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.affinoidStage_empty` (degenerate): An empty chart set gives zero.

**Affinoid-valued Banach-stage distributions** (definition). Define D_h(X,A)=Hom_(A,cts)(A_h(X,A),A) with its operator norm. Restriction of function stages induces maps D_(h+1)→D_h; their projective limit is the A-valued locally analytic distribution space. For the c₀ basis a stage dual is a bounded coefficient family, not a c₀ family. Under (a). Its API consists of `affinoidDistributionStage` (The continuous A-linear dual of the analytic coefficient stage), `affinoidDistributionStage_apply` (A stage distribution evaluates an analytic function in A) and `affinoidDistributionStage_ext` (Equality on every basis coefficient determines the functional).

*Needs:* §4.15 `affinoidAnalyticStage`; §0.3 (Strong duality for analytic compact-type spaces).

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.distributionStage_point` (compatibility): For a point, evaluation at 1 identifies the dual with A.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.distributionStage_zero` (degenerate): The zero functional has norm zero.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.distributionStage_bounded_not_c0` (non-example): The functional summing all coefficients has basis values constantly 1, so lies in the dual while its basis family is not c₀ on an infinite index set. The summation assertion requires an ultrametric coefficient field; over ℝ no continuous functional on c₀(ℕ,ℝ) has value 1 on every basis vector, since finite vectors of norm 1 would have arbitrarily large images.

**Integral distribution lattices** (construction). In a chosen normalized analytic stage, the integral distribution lattice is {μ∈D_h(X,A):‖μ‖≤1}; equivalently μ takes the analytic coefficient unit ball to A₀={a:‖a‖≤1}. This lattice is tied to the chosen Banach model. It is not asserted to equal all power-bounded elements of a nonreduced affinoid. Under (a). Its API consists of `familyIntegralLattice` (The stage-dual norm unit ball), `familyIntegralLattice_mem` (Membership is the norm bound ≤1) and `familyIntegralLattice_smul` (A₀ scalar multiplication preserves the lattice).

*Needs:* §4.15 `affinoidDistributionStage`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.integralLattice_zero` (degenerate): Zero belongs to the lattice.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.integralLattice_point`: At a point, multiplication by a lies in the lattice iff ‖a‖≤1.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.integralLattice_boundary` (non-example): Multiplication by p^(−1) is outside the lattice for the normalized p-adic norm.

**Scalar tensors of analytic stages** (comparison). For affinoid A/K and scalar c₀ stage E, the canonical map E⊗̂_(K,π)A→A_h(X,A) is an isomorphism of Banach A-modules, under the standard completed projective nonarchimedean tensor norm. This compares existing algebraic TensorProduct plus its separated completion; it does not replace that carrier. Under (a).

*Needs:* §0.3 `analyticStage`; §4.15 `affinoidAnalyticStage`; §4.2 (Completed scalar extension of ON modules and determinants).

**The canonical distribution scalar-extension map** (construction). The bilinear map D_h(X,K)×A→D_h(X,A) sends (μ,a) to the A-linear extension of μ on the scalar analytic stage, multiplied by a. It induces a continuous map D_h(X,K)⊗̂_K A→D_h(X,A). Isomorphism for infinite-dimensional A is not asserted. Under (a). Its API consists of `distributionScalarExtension` (The continuous map from the completed scalar tensor induced by the specified bilinear coefficient extension), `distributionScalarExtension_pure` (On μ⊗a its coefficient at e_α is μ(e_α)a) and `distributionScalarExtension_finite` (For finite-dimensional A/K this is an isomorphism; for arbitrary affinoids it is only a map).

*Needs:* §4.15 (Scalar tensors of analytic stages); §4.15 `affinoidDistributionStage`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.dualExtension_scalar` (degenerate): For A=K it is the identity.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.dualExtension_point` (compatibility): At a point K⊗̂_K A→Hom_A(A,A) is multiplication.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.dualExtension_derivative`: dδ_0⊗a has Amice coefficients a times those of log(1+T).

**One-disc coefficient action models** (construction). On c₀(N,A), `analyticStageDilate a` for ‖a‖≤1 has nth coefficient a^n f_n, the pullback along z↦az. `analyticStageEvaluate x` for ‖x‖≤1 is Σ f_n x^n, a continuous A-linear functional when A is complete and ultrametric. API: `analyticStageDilate_coeff`, `analyticStageDilate_comp`, `analyticStageEvaluate_hasSum`, `analyticStageEvaluate_basis`, `analyticStageEvaluate_dilate`. These are concrete specializations of the chart constructions; their coefficient formulas make the family/action comparison testable at the native pins. Needs: §0.3 stage substitution, affinoid stages here and ultrametric coefficient summation. Source: Urban Lemmas 3.4.6–3.4.7, pp. 43–44; Colmez §II.4, pp. 34–37.

**Checks.**

- `stageDilate_unit`: a=1 is identity.
- `stageDilate_zero`: a=0 retains precisely the constant coefficient, not the zero function.
- `stageDilate_quadratic`: The basis e_2 maps to a²e_2, distinguishing coordinate dilation from scalar multiplication by a.
- `stageEvaluate_zero`: Evaluation at zero is f_0.
- `stageEvaluate_quadratic`: Evaluation of e_2 at x is x², including x=1 on the boundary.
- `stageEvaluate_zeroFunction`: The zero analytic function evaluates to zero at every allowed point; constant coefficients one are not an analytic input on an infinite index set.

**Specialization of distribution families** (construction). For a bounded K-affinoid map η:A→B, construct the completed analytic-stage coefficient map S_η:c₀(I,A)→c₀(I,B), S_η(f)_i=η(f_i), using ‖η(a)‖≤C_η‖a‖; via §0.0 this is the canonical map of completed scalar tensors. A stage functional is uniquely represented by the bounded values λ_i=μ(e_i). Define sp_η(μ) on f∈c₀(I,B) by Σ_i f_i η(λ_i). The ultrametric bound C_η sup_i‖λ_i‖ ensures convergence and continuity even though λ is not c₀. This constructs D_h(X,A)→D_h(X,B), then its B-bilinear scalar extension D_h(X,A)×B→D_h(X,B). On coefficients it sends μ(e_α)⊗b to image(μ(e_α))b. It is compatible with radius transitions because the substitution matrices specialize coefficientwise and the bounded sums commute with η. Thus sp_η(μ)(S_η f)=η(μ(f)) on every stage, and the same formula holds on the global projective limit. This compatibility is a theorem of the constructed maps, not a supplied equality. For a finite residue-field specialization it gives the character-fibre distribution; an isomorphism after completed tensor is a separate hypothesis. Under (a). Its API consists of `familySpecialization` (Specialize bounded distribution coefficient families along a bounded A→B map), `familySpecialization_coeff` (Basis coefficient values map by the specified algebra homomorphism) and `familySpecialization_comp` (Successive bounded coefficient maps compose on every coefficient), `analyticStageSpecialization` (The completed coefficient map S_η), `familySpecialization_eval` (The displayed evaluation comparison) and `familySpecialization_radius` (The projective-limit comparison).

*Needs:* §4.15 `affinoidDistributionStage`; §4.15 `distributionScalarExtension`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.specialization_identity` (degenerate): Specialization along A→A is the identity on functions and on bounded dual families.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.specialization_single`: The completed stage map sends e_i⊗a to e_i⊗η(a), preserving its index and specializing its scalar.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.specialization_empty`: The empty analytic chart remains zero after any bounded coefficient map.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.specialization_atom`: A-valued aδ_x specializes to image(a)δ_x.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.specialization_logarithm` (compatibility): For finite field specialization the unbounded Amice series specializes coefficientwise, including log(1+T).
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.specialization_two_factors`: For A=K×K and η the second projection, μ(e_0)=(1,2), μ(e_1)=(3,4), all others zero. On f=e_0+5e_1 the specialization gives 22, whereas the first projection gives 16. With μ(e_n)=(1,2) for every n, specialization is still the coefficient-sum functional multiplied by 2; requiring a c₀ dual incorrectly excludes it.

**Universal-character analyticity at a common radius** (comparison). Let U be an affinoid character-space chart with A=O(U), and choose coordinates on its principal Z_p^d subgroup. The imported universal character has values χ_U(γ_i)=1+t_i. On a chart with ‖t_i‖≤r_i<1 choose h so that ‖(1+t_i)^(p^h)−1‖<p^(−1/(p−1)) for all i. Then χ_U(γ_i^(p^h z_i))=exp(z_i log((1+t_i)^(p^h))) is a restricted analytic A-valued series in z_i. Its coefficient bounds are uniform in U. Split finite torsion components separately; a general affinoid admits a finite chart cover with one common maximum h. API: `universalCharacter_stage`, `universalCharacter_stage_eval`, `universalCharacter_stage_specialize`, `universalCharacter_commonRadius`. This proves analyticity from the universal continuous character, not from continuity alone. Source: Urban Lemmas 3.4.6–3.4.7, pp. 43–44; Schneider–Teitelbaum arXiv:math/9912073v1, §2, pp. 5–7. Needs: §0.0 completed coefficient tensors, §4.15 affinoid stages, and imported character-space charts.

**Checks.**

- `universalCharacter_trivial`: t_i=0 gives the constant character one at every radius.
- `universalCharacter_firstCoefficient`: On one principal coordinate the normalized z coefficient is log((1+t)^(p^h)); replacing χ by the scalar 1+t would lose its z-dependence.
- `universalCharacter_radius` (non-example): A continuous character with a parameter outside the exp convergence bound cannot use the unshrunk logarithmic chart; h must be allowed to grow with U. The stage formula specializes to each weight at the same chosen h.

**Universal-character coefficient action** (construction). Let a semigroup Σ act by analytic maps φ_σ on charts and analytic A-valued multipliers j_σ obtained by evaluating the imported universal character. Suppose φ_(στ)=φ_σ∘φ_τ and j_(στ)=j_τ·(j_σ∘φ_τ), with unit identities. Use the common-radius character theorem and the completed A-valued versions of analyticStagePullback and analyticStageMultiplier to construct bounded stage maps R_(σ,h):A_h→A_k with evaluation j_σ(x)f(φ_σ(x)). Their refinement compatibility gives actual global maps. The right function action is R_σf=j_σ(f∘φ_σ); the left distribution action is U_σμ=μ∘R_σ. The actual universal character and the automorphic semigroup are supplier inputs. Under (a). Its API consists of `universalCharacterAction` (The projective-limit transpose of these constructed universal-character stage maps), `universalCharacterAction_stage`, `universalCharacterAction_specialize`, `coefficientAction` (Its fixed-stage version when σ preserves a stage), `coefficientAction_apply` ((U_σμ)(f)=μ(j_σ(f∘φ_σ))) and `coefficientAction_comp` (U_σU_τ=U_(στ) from R_τR_σ=R_(στ)).

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.coefficientAction_dirac`: U_σδ_x=j_σ(x)δ_(φ_σ(x)).
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.coefficientAction_specialization` (compatibility): On a principal coordinate over A=K〈W/r〉 with r<1 and φ(z)=pz, let j(z)=(1+W)^(p^h z). Then U_σδ_1=(1+W)^(p^h)δ_p. At W=w its value on z² is (1+w)^(p^h)p². Taking w=0 gives p². Using j(p) instead of j(1) gives (1+w)^(p^(h+1))p², a wrong-action test at any w for which the two units differ.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.coefficientAction_wrongScalar`: Over A=K×K with constant multiplier (2,3), φ(z)=pz and μ=(5,7)δ_1, the second-projection fiber has value 21p² on z². The first projection gives 10p². At p=3 these are 189 and 90. The Lean test constructs analyticStageDilate, the constant multiplier and analyticStageEvaluate, then applies stageDistributionSpecialization; it does not assume their evaluation comparison.

**Cocycle law and handedness** (lemma). Under the preceding cocycle identities, R_τ∘R_σ=R_(στ) and U_σ∘U_τ=U_(στ). Thus the function action is right and the dual action is left; reversing the composition of pullbacks reverses the semigroup law. Under (a).

*Needs:* §4.15 `universalCharacterAction`, the actual stage maps and their cocycle evaluation; restricted-series injectivity.



**Complete continuity from analytic contraction** (lemma). If the coordinate pullback of a semigroup element maps a finite-chart analytic stage strictly inside its analytic polydiscs and its multiplier is bounded at the destination radius, the resulting operator on functions is A-completely continuous. Its transposed action between the dual stages has finite A-image approximants with the same tail estimate. Applying Fredholm theory to a same-stage dual module additionally requires its (Pr) property, which is not implied by taking a continuous dual. Under (a).

*Needs:* §4.15 `coefficientAction`; §4.15 `universalCharacter_commonRadius`; §0.3 (Compact restriction to a smaller radius); §4.1 `finiteImage_isCompletelyContinuous`.

**Compact algebra maps with nilpotent coordinate images** (theorem). Let K be Q_p or a finite extension, B a K-Banach algebra, and f:K〈T₁,…,T_d〉→B a continuous K-algebra homomorphism. If every f(T_i) is topologically nilpotent then f is compact as a K-linear map. In particular K〈T〉→K〈T/p〉 is compact. Under (a).

**Compactness for bounded formal-series inputs** (theorem). Let A=Z_p〈T₁,…,T_d〉[[x]][1/p] with the coefficient-sup Banach norm on bounded formal x-series. A continuous Q_p-algebra homomorphism f:A→B is compact when f(T_i) and f(x) are all topologically nilpotent. This A is larger than the restricted Tate algebra in x. Under (a).

### 4.16 Banach complexes and finite-slope decompositions

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

**Bounded complexes of projective Banach modules** (definition). A Banach complex over affinoid A is a native cochain complex of A-modules with degreewise compatible complete Banach norms, continuous differentials, and only finitely many nonzero degrees. In the projective Banach complex category every degree has the property (Pr); this does not mean it is a finite-projective A-module. Morphisms and homotopies have continuous degreewise components. Each chosen norm is K-homogeneous and the A-action satisfies a uniform bound ‖ax‖≤c‖a‖‖x‖ for some c≥0 on each term. Normed models are explicitly identified with the native ModuleCat terms; no replacement cochain category is introduced. Under (a). Its API consists of `IsProjectiveBanachComplex` (Degreewise Banach/(Pr), continuous differentials and finite support), `projectiveBanachComplex_zero` (The zero complex satisfies these conditions) and `projectiveBanachComplex_shift` (Degree shifts transport the norms, differentials and finite support).

**Degreewise completely continuous representatives** (definition). A continuous cochain endomorphism U of a bounded projective Banach complex is degreewise completely continuous if each U^i satisfies the single earlier A-complete-continuity predicate. The chain condition dU=Ud is required; independent operators in the degrees do not define a complex endomorphism. Under (a). Its API consists of `DegreewiseCompletelyContinuous` (Every continuous degree map has finite A-image approximants), `degreewiseCompletelyContinuous_zero` (The zero cochain endomorphism is compact in every degree) and `degreewiseCompletelyContinuous_add` (Sums of two such representatives have the same property).

**Compactness of a homotopy endomorphism** (definition). An endomorphism class in the continuous homotopy category of bounded projective Banach complexes is compact if it has a degreewise completely continuous representative. This is an existential property of the class, not a claim that every representative is compact. Under (a). Its API consists of `CompactHomotopyEndomorphism` (There exists a continuous homotopic degreewise compact representative), `compactHomotopyEndomorphism_of_rep` (A degreewise compact representative determines a compact class) and `compactHomotopyEndomorphism_homotopy` (Continuous homotopic endomorphisms have the same compactness property).

**Characteristic series of a compact complex representative** (construction). For a chosen degreewise compact representative Ũ on a bounded projective Banach complex C, put P_(C,Ũ)(T)=∏_(i:C^i≠0)det(1−TŨ^i). This is a finite nonalternating product. It is an auxiliary entire series attached to the representative and is not an invariant of the homotopy class. Under (a). Its API consists of `complexFredholmProduct` (Finite product of the chosen degree determinants), `complexFredholmProduct_coeff_zero` (Its constant coefficient is 1) and `complexFredholmProduct_enlarge` (Adding zero degrees leaves the product unchanged).

**A contractible-complex test for characteristic products** (lemma).

*Needs:* §4.16 `complexFredholmProduct`; §4.16 `CompactHomotopyEndomorphism`.

**Numerical h-slope decomposition** (definition). For a continuous operator U on a Banach A-module, an h-slope decomposition is M=M^{≤h}⊕M^{>h}, continuously split and U-stable, with M^{≤h} finite projective, annihilated by a monic polynomial with unit constant term whose roots on every geometric rank-one fibre have valuation ≤h, and every monic polynomial with unit constant term and roots of valuation ≤h on every such fibre acting invertibly on M^{>h}. In reciprocal Fredholm coordinates Q(0)=1, the corresponding roots of Q have valuation ≥−h. The complement uses ≤h, including the endpoint. The annihilator excludes zero eigenvalues; zero has valuation +∞ and belongs to the >h part for finite h. Under (a). Its API consists of `NumericalSlopeDecomposition` (The continuous split, finite-projective ≤h summand and inclusive complement invertibility conditions), `numericalSlope_projector` (The projector has image M^{≤h} and kernel M^{>h}) and `numericalSlope_module_comparison` (A slope-adapted Fredholm factorization supplies this numerical decomposition on its fibres).

**Functoriality of slope projectors** (lemma). A continuous A-linear map intertwining two operators with h-slope decompositions preserves their ≤h and >h summands, and commutes with the projectors.

*Needs:* §4.16 (Functoriality of slope projectors).

**The finite-slope subcomplex** (lemma). If a degreewise compact cochain representative admits a common h-slope decomposition in every degree, the ≤h summands form a bounded subcomplex, the >h summands form its complementary subcomplex, and the cochain projections are continuous. Under (a).

**A finite perfect model on a slope window** (theorem). On an affinoid where the chosen representative product has a slope-adapted coprime factorization selecting the same finite h-window in each degree, the preceding ≤h subcomplex is a bounded complex of finite-projective A-modules, hence a perfect complex. Only the selected finite window has this algebraic finiteness assertion. Under (a).

**Cohomology and finite slopes** (comparison). For such a split cochain representative, H^j(C^{≤h}) identifies algebraically with the h-slope part of H^j(C). Cohomology is formed as ker d/im d even when im d is not closed; no Hausdorff Banach norm on arbitrary H^j(C) is assumed. Under (a).

**Derived base change of a finite slope complex** (comparison). On compatible slope-adapted affinoids A→B, the finite perfect slope complex base changes to C^{≤h}⊗_A B and represents its derived tensor product. It agrees with the finite slope complex over B once the imported operator/factorization base-change hypotheses hold. Cohomology commutes with underived base change only under additional flatness or vanishing-Tor hypotheses. Under (a).

For a compact operator on a projective Banach affinoid module and fixed finite h, the dimension of its exact-h fibre summand is locally constant near each rank-one point in the rank-one locus. Use slope-adapted finite-projective windows and neighborhoods on which the relevant eigenvalue norms remain in the selected bands. This assertion is not a cover of all higher-rank points of Spa(A).

**Extension through a factorized operator** (lemma). Suppose r:D→C and a:C→D are continuous intertwining maps with U_C=r a and U_D=a r. If a cohomology class f in C satisfies f=P(U_C)f with P(0)=0, write P=XQ and define its extension to D by a(Q(U_C)f). Then restricting it by r gives f. This is the type-correct finite-slope extension formula. Under (a). (Source: Pilloni, Corollary 13.2.4.2 and proof, author pp. 87–88; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

### 4.17 Fréchet presentations, Stein exhaustions and the torus order

Hypotheses shared by several targets of this subsection, cited by letter below: (a) Unless the statement explicitly gives broader field hypotheses, K is a finite extension of Q_p with v_p(p)=1, X is a compact finite-dimensional Q_p-analytic manifold, and an affinoid coefficient A has a chosen complete submultiplicative ultrametric Banach norm. Numerical slopes are tested on geometric rank-one fibres.

**Compact factorization on Fréchet presentations** (definition). Let V=lim_n V_n be a projective system of Banach modules with compact transition t_n:V_(n+1)→V_n. A compatible operator has compact-stage factorization when there are bounded a_n:V_n→V_(n+1) with U_n=t_n a_n and U_(n+1)=a_n t_n. This is additional data, not a consequence of Fréchet completeness. Under (a). Its API consists of `CompactStageFactorization` (Compact transitions t_n and bounded a_n with U_n=t_na_n and U_{n+1}=a_nt_n), `compactStageFactorization_zero` (Compact transitions with zero stage operators admit a_n=0) and `compactStageFactorization_compatible` (The factorization implies U_n t_n=t_n U_{n+1}). (Source: Urban, §2.3.12 and Lemma 2.3.13, author pp. 27–28; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §4.1 `finiteImage_isCompletelyContinuous`; §4.16 `IsProjectiveBanachComplex`.

**Checks.**

- `AnalyticDistributionTests.frechetFactor_zero` (degenerate): Zero stage operators factor through any compact transition system.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.frechetFactor_finite`: The constant system A with identity transitions and scalar U=a factors with a_n=a.
- `AnalyticDistributionTests.frechetFactor_noncompact` (non-example): The constant system c_K(N) with identity transitions fails the compact-transition condition, even if U=0.

**Finite slopes of a compact Fréchet factorization** (theorem). If the stage operators in the preceding factorization have h-slope decompositions with finite-projective ≤h summands, the transitions identify all stage ≤h summands; the induced Fréchet operator has this common finite-slope module. Its characteristic finite-window factor is independent of the chosen stage. Under (a). (Source: Urban, Lemma 2.3.13, author pp. 27–28; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §4.17 `CompactStageFactorization`; §4.16 (Independence of the finite-slope extension polynomial); §4.16 (Uniqueness of the h-slope decomposition).

**Stein exhaustions for finite-slope operators** (comparison). Import quasi-Stein/Stein spaces, their nested affinoid exhaustions, dense restriction maps and coherent Theorem B from AdicSpacesPartII R3. For a chosen coherent analytic coefficient sheaf, its section module is the Fréchet limit of affinoid section Banach modules. To use compact-stage factorization, the Stein exhaustion must give inner/compact restrictions in the actual coefficient norms; BCGP25’s relatively compact closure-proper criterion must be compared with the supplier’s Kiehl criterion. Under (a). (Source: BCGP II, Definition 2.2.17, printed p. 21; §§4.6.46–4.6.49, printed pp. 93–95; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* AdicSpacesPartII R3/quasi-stein-space; AdicSpacesPartII R3/quasi-stein-dense-restriction; AdicSpacesPartII R3/quasi-stein-theorems-a-b; §4.17 `CompactStageFactorization`.

**Character-valuation adapter** (comparison). For a Q_p-torus T, let Tᵈ be its maximal split subtorus and choose a finite Galois splitting field E. Define `torusCharacterValuation` as the negative of the imported RG2.1 translation map, under X_*(Tᵈ)⊗Q≃the rational invariant cocharacter space. The additional statement is its pairing with **geometric** χ∈X*(T_E): 〈χ,w(t)〉=v_p(χ(t)), with v_p(p)=1 on E. To prove it, average χ over Gal(E/Q_p); invariance of t and the extended valuation gives the rational-character formula after multiplying by the Galois degree, then divide in Q. Thus no assumption that every geometric character is rational is needed. Negation transports the supplier's lattice Λ_RG to Λ=−Λ_RG and its compact kernel to T_c; it also transports the supplier's quotient isomorphism. In particular the quotient is Λ, not the whole rational vector space. API: `torusCharacterValuation_pairing` (the geometric formula), `torusCharacterValuation_apartment` (w=−v_RG on all T(Q_p)), `torusCharacterValuation_splitCocharacter` (w(λ(p))=λ), `torusCharacterValuation_kernel_comparison` and `torusCharacterValuation_lattice_comparison` (transport of the named supplier objects under negation). These are sign and character comparisons, not a second kernel/lattice development. Source: BCGP II §1.8.5 and (1.8.6), p. 9; §4.6.46, pp. 93–94. Needs: the exact RG2.1 supplier above, torus character/cocharacter duality and finite splitting from ReductiveGroups Layer 7, and normalized local-field valuations.

**Checks.**

- `torusValuation_split_line`: For G_m and t=p, w(t)=1 in Z⊂Q; for t=p^(−2) it is −2; a unit has value zero. The image is Z, so 1/2 is not in the image.
- `torusValuation_anisotropic`: For the norm-one torus of an unramified quadratic extension, every Q_p-point is a unit (the norm valuation is twice its valuation); Tᵈ=0, Λ=0 and T_c=T(Q_p).
- `torusValuation_product`: For G_m times that norm-one torus, valuation ignores the anisotropic coordinate and has compact kernel Z_p^× times the whole norm-one group. Taking only rational characters must agree with, not replace without proof, the geometric-character construction.

**Positive torus monoids and spanning** (construction). Now T is a maximal torus in a Q_p-Borel of a quasi-split reductive group, with its chosen positive restricted roots. `positiveTorusMonoid` consists of t with 〈α,w(t)〉≥0 for all positive roots; `strictPositiveTorusSet` uses >0. The latter is a semigroup and need not contain identity. Its valuation image is Λ intersected with the open chamber; for the non-strict monoid it is Λ intersected with the closed chamber. Choose a strictly dominant rational cocharacter from the imported root datum and clear denominators to obtain λ_0∈Λ. For λ∈Λ choose N large so that λ+Nλ_0 is dominant. Then λ=(λ+Nλ_0)−Nλ_0 is a difference of two positive valuations. Therefore the group completion of w(T⁺) is Λ and its real span is Λ⊗R. If the root set is empty take λ_0=0 and T⁺=T, with the same conclusion; central directions occur with both signs. API: `positiveTorusMonoid_mem`, `strictPositiveTorusSet_mem`, `positiveTorusMonoid_valuation`, `positiveTorusMonoid_difference`, `positiveTorusMonoid_spans`. This uses the dominant-cocharacter supplier; it does not re-plan root data or assert that every chamber lattice monoid is a free N^r. Source: BCGP II §4.6.46, pp. 93–94, with the explicit spanning proof derived here. Needs: previous valuation construction and ReductiveGroups Layer 7 dominant chambers.

**Checks.**

- `torusPositive_SL2`: On diag(t,t^(−1)) in SL₂, the positive root is t↦t². Thus t=p has root valuation 2 and belongs to T⁺⁺; t=p^(−1) does not belong to T⁺. The valuations are N and the strict valuations are positive integers.
- `torusPositive_rootless`: For G_m alone there are no roots; T⁺=T and w(T⁺)=Z with both signs. Identity belongs even to the vacuously strict set. An N-only convention would be wrong here.
- `torusPositive_anisotropic`: The preceding anisotropic torus has zero lattice; its rootless positive set is all points and spans the zero vector space. In a product with a central split line the chamber imposes no bound on the central integer.

**Slope order and opposite apartment sign** (comparison). On Hom_R(Λ⊗R,R), define `torusSlopeLE λ′ λ` by (λ−λ′)(w(t))≥0 for all t∈T⁺. The spanning theorem gives antisymmetry. A continuous Cp-valued character has valuation zero on the compact subgroup (a compact additive subgroup of R is zero), hence factors through Λ and defines `torusCharacterSlope`. API: `torusSlopeLE_refl`, `torusSlopeLE_trans`, `torusSlopeLE_antisymm`, `torusCharacterSlope_pairing`, `torusCharacterSlope_mul`, `torusSlopeLE_center_eq`. The last says comparable slopes agree on the central split subspace since both directions are positive. For t∈Tᵈ(Q_p), ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.1's apartment translation ν_RG(t) has pairing −v_p(χ(t)); under the cocharacter identification, `torusCharacterValuation_apartment` states w(t)=−ν_RG(t), as proved by the adapter above. This sign comparison is explicit before numerical finite-slope adapters use it. Source: BCGP II §1.8.5, p. 9 and Remarks 4.6.47–4.6.48, pp. 94–95; ReductiveGroupsPartII RG2.1. Needs: the preceding monoid spanning theorem, imported apartment translation and lattice duality.

**Checks.**

- `torusSlope_SL2`: In the SL₂ one-dimensional chamber, λ_s(n)=sn satisfies λ_s≥λ_t iff s≥t. At t=p, the character t↦t^k has slope k, while apartment translation is −1.
- `torusSlope_wrong_sign` (non-example): At p, declaring w=ν_RG would assign slope −1 to the identity character of G_m. It contradicts v_p(p)=1 and reverses the SL₂ comparison between slopes 0 and 1.
- `torusSlope_rootless`: For G_m alone comparability is equality, since n and −n both test the inequality. On the anisotropic zero lattice there is exactly one slope; in a central split product comparable slopes have equal central component.

**Classical finite windows** (comparison). For a completely continuous single operator on a Banach (Pr) module, a slope-adapted finite window gives the finite-projective Riesz summand of §4.14. Over an affinoid coefficient algebra this summand defines a coherent module on that affinoid; over a field it is finite dimensional. Compact-stage factorizations identify these windows across the Fréchet presentation. This is the classical input to the analytic solid constructions in the cited source; solid localization and its reconstruction theorem are outside the scope of this roadmap. Under (a). (Source: BCGP II, §4.6.46 and Remark 4.6.49, printed pp. 93–95; derived from the cited passage, not printed there.)

*Needs:* §4.16 (A finite perfect model on a slope window); §4.17 (Stein exhaustions for finite-slope operators); §4.17 (Slope order and opposite apartment sign).

### Examples

The identity on c₀(ℕ, A) is not completely continuous, while the identity on A is; a rank-one operator has Fredholm determinant 1 − T·tr; the determinant of a diagonal operator with entries a_i tending to zero is the product ∏(1 − a_i T); over A = K × K and over the dual numbers the finite spectral transform retains the chosen rank; the characteristic series of a nilpotent 2 × 2 matrix is 1 although the operator is not the identity; a contractible complex has trivial finite-slope cohomology for every slope bound; a one-dimensional eigenvalue of valuation h belongs to the ≤ h summand.

They are not prerequisites of anything here.

## Source corrections

The following readings differ from the printed sources and are used in the statements above.

- Coleman, Lemma A3.1 (p. 432): the hypothesis on H must be that H is entire, not merely a restricted series on the closed unit disc; with the printed hypothesis the conclusion that G is constant fails. §4.3 states the entire form.
- Coleman, proof of Lemma A3.4 (p. 433): the polynomial K(T) is missing its leading term; it is T^n + Σ_{i=1}^n (−1)^i c_i T^{n−i}, as the monic Q of the construction requires. §4.10 uses the corrected form.
- Loeffler, Definition 2.12 and Remark 2.13 (pp. 4–5): the simultaneous first-difference condition with the cofinite filter on ℕ^g does not describe the completed tensor of the one-variable C^{r_i} spaces. For G = ℤ_p², r = (1/2, 0) and f = 1 ⊗ 1_{pℤ_p}, the first-difference valuation at (m_1, 0) is 0 while the condition requires it to exceed m_1/2 along infinitely many tuples, although f is a locally constant tensor. §2.2 uses the completed tensor and its wavelet norm instead.
- Pilloni, §13.1.1 (p. 84) and the proof of Corollary 13.2.4.2 (p. 87); BCGP I, §6.1.1 (p. 139): in an h-slope decomposition the complementary summand must invert every monic polynomial whose roots have valuation at most h, including equality, since a one-dimensional eigenvalue of valuation exactly h must lie in the ≤ h summand; and for P = XQ with U_C = r a the extension is f ↦ a(Q(U_C) f) followed by restriction by r, the raising map not being an endomorphism of the source. §4.16 states the endpoint convention and the factorised extension accordingly.
