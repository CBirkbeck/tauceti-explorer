# Automorphic L-functions and local factors

This roadmap constructs the analytic L-functions of characters and automorphic representations of GLₙ, together with the normalization maps needed to compare their values, poles and local factors. It starts with Fourier analysis over local fields and adeles, develops Tate's zeta distributions, then the Godement–Jacquet and Rankin–Selberg integrals. Its final interfaces compare Satake and Weil–Deligne determinants, rational period structures and finite Euler corrections. The function-field part also proves the polynomial and reciprocal-factor statements used to normalize intertwining scalars.

The library must expose the spaces, measures, distributions and comparison maps that make those theorems usable. An integral formula is accompanied by its convergence domain and continuation theorem. A local denominator is characterized by the ideal of test integrals, rather than by a choice of one test vector. A period is a class modulo the units of its rationality field, rather than a canonically chosen complex number.

## Scope and neighbouring roadmaps

The local representation categories, normalized parabolic induction, genericity, finite-place newforms and Satake isomorphisms come from **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups**, layers SR.1–SR.5. **AutomorphicFormsOnReductiveGroups**, layers AF.1–AF.4, supplies Casselman–Wallach globalizations, archimedean Langlands parameters, restricted tensor products, cusp forms, rapid decay, discrete/isobaric classification and finite-part rationality. **ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces**, layer ALS.5, supplies the geometric rational cohomology realizations. The Whittaker integrals, their analytic continuation and the scalar period comparison are built here. Ordinary multiplicity one is proved from cusp-form Fourier reconstruction and local Whittaker uniqueness; it does not require the general automorphic trace formula.

**AdelicAlgebraicGroups**, layers AA.0 and AA.2, owns adelic group topology, restricted Haar products and quotient measures. This roadmap uses those measures to construct Schwartz spaces, Poisson summation and zeta integrals. The actual intertwining operators and their operator identities belong to AA/AF; the Rankin–Selberg scalar that normalizes them belongs here. **ReductiveGroupsPartII**, RG2.5, and **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants**, IHG.3, supply the L-group, its Frobenius coset and the normalized GLₙ Satake coefficients. **ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations**, R01.2, supplies Weil–Deligne representations and their geometric-Frobenius Euler and epsilon factors. Ramified comparisons always take a compatible local parameter as an input; the existence of a general finite-place local Langlands correspondence is a separate theorem.

For function fields AL.3 constructs completion-valued additive analysis from **AlgebraicCurves**, then the unramified pure realization and cohomological determinant comparison. The scheme operations and weights are imported from **SchemeAndStackFoundations** SF.0–SF.3, **EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheaves** EDC.0–EDC.2 and EDC.8, and **DeligneWeightsAndPurity** DWP.0, DWP.1 and DWP.5–DWP.7. Rational cohomology for the particular finite-stabilizer shtuka compactifications, their boundary comparison and essential Hecke summand are part of the realization construction here. Scheme-level duality alone does not supply those stack statements.

The last layer states the complex GL₂ period and stabilization dictionary used by interpolation formulas. Constructing p-adic measures, overconvergent modular symbols and exceptional-zero formulas is separate work. Algebraicity is used only with an actual critical-value theorem and its coefficient field, sign, character and nonzero period. The rational Whittaker/cohomological period theorem of AL.3 has its own broader hypotheses; a GL₂ formula over ℚ does not establish algebraicity for arbitrary rank or arbitrary number fields.

## Conventions

Throughout the number-field part, K is a number field and F is a completion ℝ, ℂ or a finite extension of ℚₚ. The function-field part explicitly changes to K=𝔽_q(X), for X smooth, projective and geometrically connected. Write O, P, ϖ and q for a nonarchimedean local field's valuation ring, maximal ideal, uniformizer and residue cardinality. Use |ϖ|=q⁻¹ and |z|_ℂ=z z̄. All analytic functions are complex-valued; comparison with ℓ-adic factors specifies an embedding of the algebraic coefficient field.

There are two Fourier conventions, connected by an explicit comparison. Mathlib's `VectorFourier.fourierIntegral` uses ψ(−B(x,y)). The Tate transform F⁺ uses ψ(B(x,y)); therefore F⁺f(y)=F⁻f(−y). With the self-dual measure, applying either same-sign transform twice reflects f. The negative-sign formula for f(x−a) has phase ψ(−B(a,y)); multiplying f by ψ(B(x,y₀)) shifts its negative-sign transform by y−y₀.

The standard global additive character has real component exp(2πix), p-adic component exp(−2πi fracₚ(x)), and is pulled back by local trace. It is trivial on the diagonal K. At a finite place of different exponent d, its conductor is P⁻ᵈ and its self-dual additive Haar measure gives O volume q⁻ᵈᐟ². At infinity use dx over ℝ and 2 dx dy over ℂ with the trace character exp(2πi(z+z̄)). If ψ is replaced by ψ_a, its self-dual measure is multiplied by |a|¹ᐟ². Multiplicative Haar measure giving O× volume 1 is a different convention. Tate's measure uses the factor q⁻ᵈᐟ² on O×; every change of multiplicative measure scales the zeta integral and normalized distribution together.

GLₙ standard factors and Rankin–Selberg factors use the unitary center 1/2. The Godement–Jacquet determinant exponent is s+(n−1)/2. For GLₙ×GLₘ, n>m, the exponent is s−(n−m)/2 and the auxiliary index satisfies 0≤j≤n−m−1; equal ranks require an additional Schwartz function and exponent s. The two Whittaker characters in a Rankin–Selberg integral are opposite. Matrix Fourier transform uses the trace pairing and positive Tate character. Source conventions using inverse characters or transposes are transported before their functional equations are compared.

Use the native Deligne factors Γ_ℝ(s)=π⁻ˢᐟ²Γ(s/2) and Γ_ℂ(s)=2(2π)⁻ˢΓ(s). Kudla's complex Gaussian integral is πΓ_ℂ in its stated multiplicative measure, so its normalized distribution is rescaled when the canonical factor is used. Completed functions include every archimedean and finite local factor. A superscript S removes the specified places; a finite product of inverse local denominators relates the two functions meromorphically.

At a finite unramified place, local polynomials have constant term 1 and use geometric Frobenius in the Galois comparison. A pure motive of weight w has arithmetic variable s_mot=s_unit+w/2. In particular, the tensor of Symⁿ⁻¹H¹ of one elliptic curve with SymⁿH¹ of another has weight 2n−1; its center n corresponds to unitary center 1/2. Purity and matching dimensions alone do not identify its Frobenius polynomial with an automorphic one.

For function fields put z=q⁻ˢ and use z^(deg v) in the v-factor. Rational identities retain numerator and denominator, including their multiplicities. Roots on |z|=1 are excluded from the open-disc zero–pole index. Numerical division by zero, or a totalized integral outside its convergence domain, is never a replacement for continuation or a limit.

## Existing library interfaces

The following constructions are reused. The work below proves the additional local-field or representation-theoretic statements with their stated hypotheses.

| Interface | Existing construction and its precise use |
| --- | --- |
| Characters and Fourier integrals | Mathlib `AddChar`, `ContinuousMonoidHom`, `Real.fourierChar`, `ZMod.toCircle`, `ZMod.dft`, `VectorFourier.fourierIntegral`, its translation/scalar/a.e. congruence lemmas, and `SchwartzMap.fourierTransformCLM`. Translation covariance and the Schwartz Fourier operator are imported. |
| Compact-open duals | Mathlib `PontryaginDual` supplies the continuous-character space and topology. Tau Ceti's `fourierPontryaginDualEquiv` classifies the dual of an additive circle; its Fourier coefficient uniqueness and the Pontryagin Fourier–Stieltjes uniqueness results are reused in that scope. Local-field self-duality of the particular trace pairing is an additional theorem. |
| Distributions | Mathlib `TemperedDistribution` is the continuous dual with pointwise-convergence topology. Its `delta` is already evaluation at a point. The new work is the scaling action, eigenspaces, restrictions and finite-jet classification, not a second Dirac distribution. |
| Parametric integrals | Mathlib `hasDerivAt_integral_of_dominated_loc_of_deriv_le`, `mellin`, `mellin_differentiableAt_of_isBigO_rpow` and `mellinInv_mellin_eq`. Local integrability, strict endpoint exponent margins, continuity at the inversion point and integrability on the Mellin line remain hypotheses. |
| Adeles and Euler products | Tau Ceti's **GlobalNumberFields**, layers 0, 5, 6, 9 and 10, and **LocalFieldsRamification**, layer 3. The completed **RestrictedProducts** roadmap and the current `TauCeti.RestrictedProductGroup` and `TauCeti.rationalDiagonal` APIs are reused. **ArithmeticDirichletSeries**, layers 3 and 8, supplies analytic Euler products and Landau positivity. |
| Conductors | Tau Ceti's **ClassFieldTheory**, layer 7, supplies the attained character conductor and local Artin normalization. The analytic conductor is an adapter of that arithmetic object. |
| Rank-one checks | Mathlib's primitive Dirichlet completed functional equation, Gaussian Fourier transform, theta identity, finite Gauss sums, completed Riemann zeta functional equation and residue, and number-field class number/regulator/discriminant definitions and real one-sided Dedekind residue limit. The real residue limit alone does not assert complex continuation. Current Tau Ceti `NumberField.exists_differentiableOn_eq_dedekindZeta_sub` and `NumberField.ne_zero_of_eqOn_dedekindZeta` already give the Dedekind specialization near Re(s)=1; use them in that scope. The general Hecke continuation and adelic measure comparison remain the targets here. |
| Holomorphic modular L-functions | Tau Ceti `CuspForm.abscissaOfAbsConv_qExpansion_coeff_le`, `CuspForm.LSeries_qExpansion_coeff_eq` and `CuspForm.hasEntireExtension_qExpansion_coeff`. In the coefficient normalization the recorded absolute-convergence bound is Re(s)>k/2+1 and the comparison includes width⁻ˢ. Current `HeckeRing.GL2.Newform.LSeries_eulerProduct_hasProd` and its value forms already give analytic Euler products with the bad-prime factors included. These are used for the modular specialization. |
| Polynomial factors and orders | Mathlib `Matrix.charpolyRev` is det(1−T M). `MeromorphicOn.divisor`, its multiplication/inversion lemmas and `meromorphicOrderAt_mul` supply divisor arithmetic. The latter adds native `WithTop ℤ` orders even in the infinite-order cases; no replacement order function is constructed. |

All local APIs below are proposed extensions of those carriers. The suggested file illustrates signatures and discriminating examples; the mathematical hypotheses in this document define their scope.

## Layers and construction order

| Layer | Library built |
| --- | --- |
| AL.0 | Annihilators, self-dual measures, local and adelic Schwartz–Bruhat analysis, Poisson summation and Bessel transforms. |
| AL.1 | Tate eigendistributions, local/global L and epsilon factors, Hecke continuation and CM normalization. |
| AL.2 | Godement–Jacquet standard factors, newform tests, global growth and positivity, and Maass standard functions. |
| AL.3 | Whittaker models, Rankin–Selberg analysis, multiplicity/converse theorems, periods, and function-field rational normalizers. |
| AL.4 | Satake/L-group determinants, conditional Weil–Deligne comparisons and factor operations. |
| AL.5 | Finite Euler corrections, critical-value normalization, sign vanishing and refined GL₂ factors. |

Construct AL.0 and AL.1 first. Next construct the local integral prefixes of AL.2 and AL.3; the ramified Godement–Jacquet test then uses the finite-place Rankin–Selberg induced-factor product. The global analytic prefix of AL.3 precedes AL.2's absolute convergence and growth results, which use the positive self-pair and the Jacquet–Shalika bound. AL.4's determinant interface precedes the function-field and motivic suffix of AL.3. Rational periods use the geometric rational structures of AF.4 and ALS.5 after the analytic Whittaker model has been constructed. The document groups targets by layer; these finer dependencies specify their acyclic construction order.

For named APIs, `LocalFourier` means `TauCeti.LocalFourier`, `SchwartzBruhat` means `TauCeti.SchwartzBruhat`, `TateZeta` means `TauCeti.TateZeta`, and `ALk` means `TauCeti.AutomorphicLFunctions.ALk`. A definition's tests specify concrete computations, comparisons or failures that distinguish its normalization.


## AL.0 — Local and adelic Fourier analysis


### Annihilators and compact-open Fourier identities


<a id="pairing-annihilator"></a>

**Annihilator for a bilinear character pairing.** Construct U⊥={w∈W | ψ(L(u,w))=1 for every u∈U} as an AddSubgroup W. It is generally not an R-submodule. Its data is exactly this carrier and the inherited additive subgroup operations.

Assume: R is a commutative ring; V and W are additive commutative groups and R-modules. ψ is a native AddChar R Circle; L:V×W→R is R-bilinear; U is a native additive subgroup of V. No topology, nontriviality or nondegeneracy is built into this data.

API:

- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_bot`: The annihilator of the zero additive subgroup is the full subgroup W.
- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_zero`: For the zero bilinear pairing the annihilator of every U is W.
- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_antitone`: U⊆U′ implies (U′)⊥⊆U⊥ for the same ψ and L.
- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_comap`: For a linear T:W′→W, the annihilator for (v,w′)↦L(v,Tw′) equals the native comap of U⊥ along T. This uses native LinearMap.compl₂.

Tests:

- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_zmod_two`: For R=V=W=Z/2, the standard ZMod.toCircle character, multiplication pairing and U=V, the annihilator is zero.
- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_trivial_character`: For ψ=1 and every L,U, the annihilator is W.
- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_zmultiples_eq_kernel`: For V=W=R, multiplication pairing and U the additive subgroup generated by 1, U⊥ equals the native kernel of ψ.toAddMonoidHom. U cannot be replaced by all of R in this assertion.
- `LocalFourier.pairingAnnihilator_not_real_submodule`: For R=V=W=R-real, ψ(x)=exp(2πix), multiplication pairing and U=Z·1, the annihilator contains 1 and does not contain 1/2. Thus it is not stable under real scalar multiplication.

### Characters, trace duality and self-dual measures


<a id="standard-additive-character"></a>

**The standard additive character.** Fix ψ_Q,∞(x)=exp(2πix) and ψ_Q,p(x)=exp(−2πi frac_p(x)); on a completion K_v use ψ_v=ψ_Q,w∘Tr_{K_v/Q_w}. Their restricted product is trivial on the diagonal K. The finite conductor is the inverse different D_v^(−1)=P_v^(−d_v), while the archimedean characters are exp(2πix) and exp(2πi(z+z̄)).

Assume: K number field; frac_p(x) denotes the rational p-primary part modulo Z. These are Kudla’s positive infinity characters, the inverse of Tate’s opposite global choice.

API:

- `AL0.StandardAdditiveCharacter.real_one`: ψ_R(1)=1 and ψ_R(1/2)=−1.
- `AL0.StandardAdditiveCharacter.complex_imaginary`: ψ_C(i)=1 although i≠0; nontriviality does not mean an injective character.

**Self-dual local additive Haar measure.** The ψ_v-self-dual additive Haar is normalized by μ(O)=q^(−d_v/2), μ_R=dx and μ_C=2 dxdy for the standard trace characters. For ψ_a(x)=ψ(ax), μ_{ψ_a}=|a|^(1/2)μ_ψ. For A=P^m, μ(A)μ(A⊥)=1. This additive normalization is distinct from prescribing multiplicative O×-volume1.

- `AL0.SelfDualHaar.dual_volume`: μ(A)μ(A⊥)=1.

**The additive local-field duality map.** For a local field F and continuous nontrivial additive character ψ, define ι_ψ(y)(x)=ψ(xy), taking values in native PontryaginDual(Multiplicative F). It is a continuous group homomorphism from Multiplicative F. The local-field self-duality theorem upgrades this particular map to a topological group isomorphism.

Assume: Use multiplication in F and compact-open topology on the native continuous-character group; do not replace the dual by a new carrier.

<a id="local-additive-self-duality"></a>

**Self-duality of a local additive group.** For F=R,C or a finite extension of Q_p, a continuous nontrivial additive ψ gives a bijective ι_ψ:F→PontryaginDual(Multiplicative F), and its inverse is continuous. Thus open-lattice annihilators are compact and their double annihilators equal the original lattice.

### Local Schwartz–Bruhat spaces and finite Fourier levels


<a id="local-schwartz-bruhat-space"></a>

**The local Schwartz–Bruhat space S(F), its F^×-action and tempered distributions.** For F nonarchimedean, S(F) is the complex vector space of functions f : F → ℂ for which there is r ≥ 0 with supp f ⊆ P^{−r} and f constant on cosets of P^r (SR.1's locally constant compactly supported carrier over ℂ); S(F)′ is its algebraic dual. For F = ℝ, ℂ, S(F) is Mathlib's Schwartz space 𝓢(F, ℂ) (F viewed as a real vector space) and S(F)′ = 𝓢′(F, ℂ) is Mathlib's TemperedDistribution. F^× acts by r(a)f(x) = f(xa) and on distributions by ⟨r′(a)λ, f⟩ = ⟨λ, r(a^{−1})f⟩. δ₀ is ⟨δ₀, f⟩ = f(0).

Assume: F is a completion k_v of a number field k. Nonarchimedean: ring of integers O, maximal ideal P = ϖO, q = #O/P, |ϖ| = q^{−1}, ord : F^× → ℤ. Archimedean: F = ℝ with the usual |x|, or F = ℂ with |x| = x·x̄. ω_s(x) = |x|^s. Kudla p. 115: tempered distributions at a finite place are arbitrary ℂ-linear functionals; at ℝ, ℂ they are the continuous functionals on the Fréchet space.

API:

- `SchwartzBruhat.LocalSpace`: S(F): SR.1's carrier for F nonarchimedean, 𝓢(F, ℂ) for F = ℝ, ℂ.
- `SchwartzBruhat.LocalSpace.act`: r(a)f(x) = f(xa), a group action of F^× by linear maps.
- `SchwartzBruhat.LocalSpace.act_apply`: (r(a)f)(x) = f(xa).
- `SchwartzBruhat.LocalSpace.Dual`: S(F)′: algebraic dual (finite place) or 𝓢′(F, ℂ) (infinite place), with r′.

- `SchwartzBruhat.LocalSpace.gaussian_mem`: e^{−πx²} ∈ S(ℝ) and e^{−2πxx̄} ∈ S(ℂ).
- `SchwartzBruhat.LocalSpace.delta_invariant`: r′(a)δ₀ = δ₀ for all a ∈ F^×.
- `SchwartzBruhat.LocalSpace.const_not_mem`: The constant function 1 on F is not in S(F): its support is not compact (finite place) and it does not decay (ℝ).

<a id="finite-schwartz-period-level"></a>

**Finite-place Schwartz levels.** A locally constant compactly supported complex function on a nonarchimedean local field is supported in P^(−M) and invariant under translation by P^N for some integers M,N. Thus it is a finite linear combination of coset indicators on P^(−M)/P^N, where N≥−M.

**Finite-place Schwartz Fourier inversion.** The Fourier transform carries SR.1’s finite-place Schwartz carrier into itself and its square is f(x)↦f(−x), with the self-dual Haar. For the positive kernel use F⁺f(x)=F⁻f(−x) where F⁻ is the native transform with the same ψ.

**Archimedean Schwartz Fourier comparison.** At R use native SchwartzMap Fourier with the positive source transform F⁺f(ξ)=F⁻f(−ξ). At C identify C≃R² and the trace pairing Tr(zw)=2(Re z Re w−Im z Im w); with self-dual2dxdy, F⁺ preserves SchwartzMap and F⁺²f(x)=f(−x). The Gaussian exp(−2π|z|²) is fixed by this transform.

Assume: The complex absolute value for Tate is|z|²; the native Euclidean norm remains|z|. The trace pairing differs from the Hermitian inner product.

**Local Fourier transform, self-dual measure and inversion on S(F).** Fix a nontrivial additive character ψ of F and identify F with its dual by y ↦ (x ↦ ψ(xy)). For f ∈ S(F), f̂(x) = ∫_F f(y)ψ(xy)dy lies in S(F), and f ↦ f̂ is a linear isomorphism of S(F). There is a unique Haar measure dx, the self-dual measure for ψ, with f̂̂(x) = f(−x). For β ∈ F^× and ψ_β(x) = ψ(βx), the self-dual measure for ψ_β is |β|^{1/2}dx, and the ψ_β-transform of f is |β|^{1/2}r(β)f̂. For F nonarchimedean the conductor ν(ψ) is the largest ν with ψ trivial on P^{−ν}. Distributions: ⟨λ̂, f⟩ = ⟨λ, f̂⟩.

Assume: F is a completion k_v of a number field k. Nonarchimedean: ring of integers O, maximal ideal P = ϖO, q = #O/P, |ϖ| = q^{−1}, ord : F^× → ℤ. Archimedean: F = ℝ with the usual |x|, or F = ℂ with |x| = x·x̄. ω_s(x) = |x|^s. Kudla's convention ψ(x) = e(x) = e^{2πix} on ℝ and e(x + x̄) on ℂ (3.30) has positive sign; Mathlib's 𝓕 uses e^{−2πi⟨x, w⟩}, so f̂_Kudla(x) = 𝓕f(−x) at ℝ, and at ℂ one also rescales by 2 through the trace pairing.

### Adelic Schwartz spaces, Poisson summation and partial transforms


<a id="adelic-schwartz-bruhat-space"></a>

**The adelic Schwartz–Bruhat space S(𝔸) and its standard functions.** S(𝔸_K) is the locally convex inductive limit over finite-place compact-open support/period levels of SchwartzMap(K_∞,ℂ) tensor the corresponding finite-dimensional spaces of finite-adelic functions. Equivalently the archimedean tensor product is completed; finite linear combinations of products of one-place functions are dense. They need not exhaust S(𝔸_K) when several archimedean places occur. Distinguished finite-place tensors are 1_{O_v} almost everywhere. Fourier transform and tensor distributions extend continuously from these dense products. Tate’s conditions 𝔷1–𝔷3 are analytic properties to prove for this space, not its definition.

Assume: k a number field; 𝔸 its adele ring with the restricted-product topology; ψ = ∏_v ψ_v a nontrivial character of 𝔸 trivial on k.

API:

- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace`: S(𝔸) is the locally convex inductive limit of finite-place support/period levels tensored with SchwartzMap(K∞,ℂ); the archimedean tensor factors are completed.
- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace.pure`: The factorizable function ⊗_v f_v, given f_v ∈ S(k_v) with f_v = f_v^o outside a finite set.
- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace.pure_apply`: (⊗ f_v)(x) = ∏_v f_v(x_v), a finite product for each x.

- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace.span_pure_dense`: Finite linear combinations of one-place factorizable functions are dense in S(𝔸); no algebraic spanning equality is asserted when several archimedean factors occur.

Tests:

- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace.standard_mem`: f^o = ⊗_{v<∞} 1_{O_v} ⊗ ⊗_{v|∞} Gaussian lies in S(𝔸).
- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace.theta_rat`: For k = ℚ and f = 1_Ẑ ⊗ e^{−πx²}, Σ_{ξ∈ℚ} f(tξ) = Σ_{n∈ℤ} e^{−πt²n²} for t > 0.
- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace.pure_eq_zero`: If one local factor f_v is 0, then ⊗f_v = 0.
- `SchwartzBruhat.AdelicSpace.not_restricted`: The product ∏_p 1_{pℤ_p} is not in S(𝔸): infinitely many factors differ from f_p^o, and it is the indicator of the compact but not open set ∏_p pℤ_p ⊂ 𝔸_f, so it is not locally constant.

## AL.1 — Tate zeta distributions and Hecke L-functions


### Quasi-characters and eigen-distribution spaces


<a id="local-quasicharacter-conductor"></a>

**Local quasi-characters, unramified characters and the conductor exponent.** A quasi-character of F^× is a continuous homomorphism ω : F^× → ℂ^×; it is a character if |ω| = 1. There is a unique real σ (the exponent) with |ω(x)| = |x|^σ, so ω = ω_u·ω_σ with ω_u a character. For F nonarchimedean, ω is unramified if ω is trivial on O^×; the unramified quasi-characters are exactly x ↦ t^{ord x} = |x|^s with t = q^{−s} ∈ ℂ^×, s determined modulo 2πi/log q (Tate Lemma 2.3.1). For ramified ω the conductor exponent c(ω) is the smallest integer c ≥ 1 with ω trivial on 1 + P^c; put c(ω) = 0 for unramified ω. For F = ℝ every quasi-character is ωω_s with ω(x) = x^{−a}, a ∈ {0, 1} (Kudla (3.18)); for F = ℂ it is ωω_s with ω(x) = x^{−a}x̄^{−b}, a, b ∈ ℤ, min(a, b) = 0 (Kudla (3.20)). The conductor is an analytic adapter of the attained characterConductorExp supplied by ClassFieldTheory Layer7; its arithmetic construction is imported.

Assume: F is a completion k_v of a number field k. Nonarchimedean: ring of integers O, maximal ideal P = ϖO, q = #O/P, |ϖ| = q^{−1}, ord : F^× → ℤ. Archimedean: F = ℝ with the usual |x|, or F = ℂ with |x| = x·x̄. ω_s(x) = |x|^s. The archimedean normal forms are Kudla's (after Weil); they differ from the common sgn^a normalisation: sgn(x) = x^{−1}|x|, so sgn = x^{−1}·ω_1.

<a id="local-zeta-integral"></a>

**The local Tate zeta integral z(s, ω; f).** For a character ω of F^×, s ∈ ℂ with Re s > 0 and f ∈ S(F), z(s, ω; f) = ∫_{F^×} f(x)ω(x)|x|^s d^×x converges absolutely (Kudla (3.3)); s ↦ z(s, ω; f) is holomorphic on Re s > 0 (Tate Lemma 2.4.1, differentiation under the integral), and f ↦ z(s, ω; f) is a nonzero element z(s, ω) ∈ S′(ωω_s). In Tate's notation, ζ(f, c) = ∫ f(α)c(α)d^×α for quasi-characters c of exponent > 0, and z(s, ω; f) = ζ(f, ωω_s). The integral satisfies z(s, ωω_t; f) = z(s + t, ω; f) and z(s, ω; r(a)f) = (ωω_s)(a)^{−1}z(s, ω; f).

Assume: F is a completion k_v of a number field k. Nonarchimedean: ring of integers O, maximal ideal P = ϖO, q = #O/P, |ϖ| = q^{−1}, ord : F^× → ℤ. Archimedean: F = ℝ with the usual |x|, or F = ℂ with |x| = x·x̄. ω_s(x) = |x|^s. Measures as in Kudla: at a finite place d^×x gives O^× volume 1; at ℝ and ℂ, d^×x = |x|^{−1}dx with dx Lebesgue (resp. twice Lebesgue) measure. Tate instead gives O^× the volume N𝔡^{−1/2}. Rescaling d^×x by c>0 rescales z and z₀=z/L by c, since L is fixed. It leaves ε and γ unchanged when both sides use the same rescaling and the additive Fourier measure is fixed. A standard test vector with z₀-value1 must then be rescaled by c^(−1). ω unitary; the quasi-character case is the twist ω_t.

**The spaces S′(ω) of ω-eigendistributions.** For a quasi-character ω of F^×, S′(ω) = {λ ∈ S(F)′ : r′(a)λ = ω(a)λ for all a ∈ F^×} (Kudla Definition 3.1). Restriction along C_c^∞(F^×) ⊂ S(F) gives an exact sequence 0 → S′(ω)₀ → S′(ω) → C_c^∞(F^×)′(ω) (3.2), where S′(ω)₀ is the space of ω-eigendistributions supported at 0 (vanishing on C_c^∞(F^×)); here C_c^∞(F^×) means locally constant compactly supported functions at a finite place.

Assume: F is a completion k_v of a number field k. Nonarchimedean: ring of integers O, maximal ideal P = ϖO, q = #O/P, |ϖ| = q^{−1}, ord : F^× → ℤ. Archimedean: F = ℝ with the usual |x|, or F = ℂ with |x| = x·x̄. ω_s(x) = |x|^s. At ℝ, ℂ, C_c^∞(F^×) ⊂ 𝓢(F, ℂ) consists of smooth functions with compact support in F^×.

- `TateZeta.mem_eigenSpace`: λ ∈ S′(ω) ↔ ∀ a, r′(a)λ = ω(a)λ.

### Local normal forms, uniqueness and the exceptional extension


<a id="unramified-local-theory"></a>

**Unramified local theory: z(s, ω) = L(s, ω)z₀(s, ω).** Let F be nonarchimedean and ω unramified with ω(ϖ) = t; put L(s, ω) = (1 − tq^{−s})^{−1}. For τ = [1] − [ϖ^{−1}] ∈ ℤ[F^×] and f ∈ S(F), r(τ)f = f − r(ϖ^{−1})f has compact support in F^×, so ⟨z₀(s, ω), f⟩ = ∫_{F^×}(r(τ)f)(x)ωω_s(x)d^×x (3.5) is entire in s and z₀(s, ω) ∈ S′(ωω_s). When ‖tq^(−s)‖<1, equivalently Re(s)>log‖t‖/log q, z(s, ω) = L(s, ω)z₀(s, ω) (3.6); this identity continues z(s, ω) meromorphically to ℂ. For unitary ω the convergence region is Re(s)>0. With f^o = 1_O, ⟨z₀(s, ω), f^o⟩ = 1 for all s (3.8); so z₀(s, ω) is never zero, z(s, ω; f)/L(s, ω) is entire for every f, and for each s some f (namely f^o) makes it nonzero: L(s, ω) is the greatest common denominator of the zeta integrals (3.9).

Assume: F is a completion k_v of a number field k. Nonarchimedean: ring of integers O, maximal ideal P = ϖO, q = #O/P, |ϖ| = q^{−1}, ord : F^× → ℤ. Archimedean: F = ℝ with the usual |x|, or F = ℂ with |x| = x·x̄. ω_s(x) = |x|^s. Measures as in Kudla: at a finite place d^×x gives O^× volume 1; at ℝ and ℂ, d^×x = |x|^{−1}dx with dx Lebesgue (resp. twice Lebesgue) measure. Tate instead gives O^× the volume N𝔡^{−1/2}. Rescaling d^×x by c>0 rescales z and z₀=z/L by c, since L is fixed. It leaves ε and γ unchanged when both sides use the same rescaling and the additive Fourier measure is fixed. A standard test vector with z₀-value1 must then be rescaled by c^(−1).

**The invariant distributions: S′(ω₀) is one-dimensional.** At a finite place, the F^×-invariant distributions S′(ω₀) form the line ℂ·δ₀, although (3.11) only bounds the dimension by 2. The distribution ⟨λ₀, f⟩ = ⟨d^×x, f − f(0)f^o⟩ (3.12) is an O^×-invariant preimage of d^×x with ⟨λ₀, f^o⟩ = 0, and r′(ϖ)λ₀ = λ₀ − δ₀ (3.13). So F^× acts on the span of δ₀, λ₀ through x ↦ [[1, −ord x], [0, 1]] (3.14), a non-semisimple representation whose invariants are ℂ·δ₀; d^×x does not extend to an F^×-invariant distribution on S(F).

**Ramified local theory: z(s, ω) is entire and L(s, ω) = 1.** Let F be nonarchimedean and ω ramified with conductor c. For f ∈ S(F), ∫_{F^× − P^n} f(x)ωω_s(x)d^×x is independent of n for n large, which continues z(s, ω; f) to an entire function; z₀(s, ω) := z(s, ω) is a basis vector of S′(ωω_s) for every s (3.15), and L(s, ω) := 1 (3.16). The standard function f^o = ω^{−1}·1_{O^×} (3.17) has ⟨z₀(s, ω), f^o⟩ = 1, so the gcd property (3.9) holds.

**Archimedean local theory: Γ-factors and the standard functions (Proposition 3.5).** F = ℝ: for ω(x) = x^{−a}, a ∈ {0, 1}, put L(s, ω) = π^{−s/2}Γ(s/2) (3.19) and f^o = f_a = x^a e^{−πx²}. F = ℂ: for ω(x) = x^{−a}x̄^{−b}, min(a, b) = 0, put L(s, ω) = (2π)^{1−s}Γ(s) (3.21) and f^o = f_{a,b} = x^a x̄^b e^{−2πxx̄}. Then (i) z₀(s, ω) := L(s, ω)^{−1}z(s, ω) continues to an entire function of s and is a basis vector of S′(ωω_s) for every s; (ii) ⟨z₀(s, ω), f^o⟩ = 1. (iii) z(s, ω) is meromorphic with simple poles exactly at the poles of L(s, ω): at F = ℝ, s = −r with r ∈ 2ℤ_{≥0}, residue a nonzero multiple of D^{a+r}δ₀ ∈ S′(ωω_{−r}); at F = ℂ, s = −r with r ∈ ℤ_{≥0}, residue a nonzero multiple of D^{a+r}D̄^{b+r}δ₀. At a pole the constant term of the Laurent expansion extends ωω_{−r}(x)d^×x to S(F) but not to an element of S′(ωω_{−r}).

A standard test vector with z₀-value1 must then be rescaled by c^(−1). Kudla's normalisations are Weil's: L(s, ω) does not depend on a (resp. a, b), unlike the sgn^a normalisation. For a general Schwartz input the initial absolutely convergent region is Re(s)>a over R and Re(s)>(a+b)/2 over C. Cancellation by the special f_a or f_{a,b} improves its own integral to Re(s)>0; it does not improve convergence for every Schwartz input.

### Canonical archimedean factors


<a id="canonical-archimedean-factor"></a>

**Canonical archimedean factors.** For unitary-normalized characters, L_R(s,sgn^a|·|^t)=Γ_R(s+t+a), a∈{0,1}, and L_C(s,(z/|z|)^κ|·|_C^t)=Γ_C(s+t+|κ|/2). For a real discrete-series block D_k⊗|det|^t use Γ_C(s+t+(k−1)/2), k≥2. General GL_n archimedean factors multiply over the imported Weil constituents. Kudla’s complex Gaussian zeta normalization is πΓ_C, so its distribution is rescaled to the canonical factor.

Assume: Γ_R=π^(−s/2)Γ(s/2); Γ_C=2(2π)^(−s)Γ(s); |z|_C=zz̄.

API:

- `AL1.CanonicalArchimedeanFactor.real`: Real factors are Γ_R(s+t+a).
- `AL1.CanonicalArchimedeanFactor.complex`: Complex factors are Γ_C(s+t+|κ|/2).
- `AL1.CanonicalArchimedeanFactor.discrete_series`: The weight-k block has Γ_C(s+t+(k−1)/2).
- `AL1.CanonicalArchimedeanFactor.direct_sum`: Weil direct sums multiply the gamma factors.

Tests:

- `AL1.CanonicalArchimedeanFactor.complex_negative_weight`: κ=−3,t=0 gives Γ_C(s+3/2), equal to κ=3.

<a id="archimedean-standard-epsilon"></a>

**The archimedean standard epsilon factor.** For the positive standard Tate character, a real Weil constituent1 has epsilon1, sgn has epsilon i, and I_w=Ind_(W_C)^(W_R)(z/|z|)^w, w≥1, has epsilon i^(w+1). A weight-k discrete-series constituent therefore has epsilon i^k. Over C an angular character of weightκ has epsilon i^|κ|. Direct sums multiply these factors; norm twists do not change these archimedean constants.

Assume: I_0=1⊕sgn is reducible and gives epsilon i by multiplication. The convention is the one in Chenevier–Taïbi footnote6; a negative Fourier character requires the central-character(-1) comparison.

### Global distributions and completed Euler products


<a id="global-eigendistributions"></a>

**Factorizable distributions and global uniqueness (Lemma 4.1, Theorem 4.2).** A restricted family of continuous local distributions normalized on almost every standard vector defines a continuous restricted-tensor distribution. A nonzero global ω-eigendistribution factors into the local eigenlines and the global eigenline has dimension1. No factorization converse is asserted for arbitrary distributions: a sum of two independent product distributions need not be decomposable.

In Tate's form (Definition 4.4.1), ζ(f, c) = ∫ f(𝔞)c(𝔞)d^×𝔞 for quasi-characters c trivial on k^× of exponent > 1, with Tate's measure d^×𝔞 = ∏_v d^×𝔞_v.

Every local factor z₀ in (4.3) uses the same chosen multiplicative measure as z. Standard f_v^o has z₀-value1 with Kudla’s unit-volume convention; under Tate’s finite-place measure rescale f_v^o by N𝔡_v^(1/2).

The completed Λ(s,π)=∏_v L(s,π_v) has meromorphic continuation and Λ(s,π)=ε(s,π)Λ(1−s,π∨). If n≥2 it is entire. For n=1 its only possible poles are the Tate norm-character poles. The product of local epsilon factors is independent of the global additive character.

Assume: K is a number field; π is unitary cuspidal. The initial matrix-integral construction gives a sufficiently far-right half-plane; the Re(s)>1 Euler-product boundary additionally uses the self-pair Rankin–Selberg mean-square coefficient argument.

Over a function field an entire standard L-function is a polynomial in q^(−s) times a real exponential, hence has order at most1.

### Centered entire functions and paired products

Define `AL2.IsCenteredOrderOne(f)` for f:ℂ→ℂ by requiring f entire and, for every ε>0, a C>0 such that |f(z)|≤exp(C(1+|z|^(1+ε))) for all z. Its APIs `mul`, `translate` and `polynomial` give closure under products and translation and inclusion of polynomials. For f≢0, apply Mathlib `AnalyticOnNhd.sum_divisor_le` at a nonzero centre to obtain a multiplicity-counted zero bound C_ε(1+R^(1+ε)) for R≥1. Tests: 1 satisfies the predicate; every polynomial satisfies it; exp(z²) fails it, although exp(z) satisfies it.

**Paired Hadamard theorem.** Suppose f has this growth, f(−z)=δf(z) for δ∈{1,−1}, all its zeros lie on the imaginary axis, and f(x) is positive real for all sufficiently large positive real x. Then there are m≥0, c>0 and a finite or countable multiset of positive real numbers γ, with Σγ⁻²<∞, such that

f(z)=c z^m ∏γ(1+z²/γ²), locally uniformly on ℂ, and δ=(−1)^m.

Multiplicity is retained, including the zero of order m at the origin. Obtain the multiset from the discrete zero divisor. Jensen bounds give convergence of the paired product. Hadamard factorization leaves an affine exponential; parity removes its linear part, and positivity fixes the constant. Every derivative at zero and at a positive real point is real and nonnegative. If f is not a polynomial, every derivative at a positive real point is strictly positive and every coefficient of z^(m+2j), j≥0, is positive. For polynomials, coefficients above the degree vanish. Tests: f=1+z² has vanishing higher derivatives; f=sinh z has strictly positive derivatives for x>0; f=1−z² violates the imaginary-zero and positivity hypotheses.

Source: Yun–Zhang, Appendix B, Proposition B.1 and its factorization argument, published pp.902–903; the non-polynomial strictness condition is required. Prerequisites: Mathlib entire/analytic functions, their derivatives and meromorphic zero orders; Mathlib `AnalyticOnNhd.circleAverage_log_norm` and `AnalyticOnNhd.sum_divisor_le`; the canonical product and Hadamard factorization argument constructed here. AL.2's standard superpositivity theorem applies this result to f(z)=Λ(1/2+z).


### Superpositivity


<a id="standard-superpositivity"></a>

**Super-positivity of the standard completion.** Let π be unitary, self-dual and cuspidal, with entire completed standard L-function. Under RH in the number-field case, every derivative of the real conductor-balanced Λ at1/2 is nonnegative. If centered Λ is non-polynomial, a nonzero derivative of order r forces every derivative of order r+2j to be positive. A constant centered function has positive zeroth derivative and zero higher derivatives.

Assume: Use the unitary normalization, global root number±1, order≤1, and positivity sufficiently far right. For the function-field specialization use AL.3’s pure realization and cohomological determinant theorem.

Duke’s completion π^(−s)Γ((s+ε+ir)/2)Γ((s+ε−ir)/2)L_f(s) is π^ε times this canonical one.

<a id="rs-local-convergence"></a>

**Local convergence and continuity.** For fixed generic π_n,π_m, all Ψ_j converge absolutely in a right half-plane, locally uniformly in s; at infinity they are jointly continuous bilinear forms on the smooth Fréchet models, extending to the completed projective tensor product. If both irreducible generic inputs are unitary, the local integrals converge absolutely for Re(s)≥1; this closed boundary estimate is needed in the strong multiplicity-one argument.

Assume: Parameters in compact sets require the uniform seminorm estimates; a K-finite algebraic tensor statement alone is insufficient.

At infinity use L(s,σ_n⊗σ_m) for the imported archimedean Weil parameters and prove that all Ψ/L are entire, with no common zero at any point.

### Induction, functional equations and test realization


<a id="rs-induced-factor-product"></a>

**Nonarchimedean factors under normalized induction.** Let F be nonarchimedean and π=Ind_P^GL_n(⊠_i π_i) and π′=Ind_Q^GL_m(⊠_j π′_j) be irreducible generic normalized inductions, with every block irreducible essentially square-integrable. Then L(s,π)=∏_i L(s,π_i) and L(s,π×π′)=∏_(i,j)L(s,π_i×π′_j). For a rank-one norm character, L(s,π×|·|^t)=L(s+t,π). These are exact identities of normalized local factors, at this finite place.

Assume: Use the induced representations themselves, with δ_P^(1/2), not arbitrary irreducible quotients of reducible induction. The irreducible generic range suffices for the newform application; no general nongeneric quotient product theorem is asserted. This target is the finite-place product needed by the ramified Godement–Jacquet newform proof. No archimedean induction-compatibility input is inferred from the finite SR.2 contract.

<a id="rs-archimedean-realization"></a>

**Archimedean realization of holomorphic multiples.** For the ordered induced Whittaker-type representations of Jacquet Theorem2.6, every m(s)=h(s)L(s,σ⊗σ′) in the space L(σ⊗σ′) is represented by the completed projective tensor RS integral when n>m, and by a finite sum of such integrals with Schwartz Φ_i when n=m. Here h is entire and, on every finite vertical strip, P(s)m(s) is bounded whenever P is a polynomial clearing the poles of L on that strip. For irreducible induced representations and m=n−1 or m=n, L itself is a finite sum of K-finite test integrals (Gaussian-polynomial Φ_i when n=m). No arbitrary-entire-multiple claim, arbitrary-rank-gap K-finite claim, or reducible-input extension of Theorem2.7 is made.

Assume: Use Jacquet’s compact-picture models with Re(u₁)≤⋯≤Re(u_r) and Re(u′₁)≤⋯≤Re(u′_r′). The required vertical-strip boundedness is the definition of L(σ⊗σ′) on pp.5–6, not merely that h is entire. Irreducibility is required for Theorem2.7; Remark2.8 leaves the corresponding reducible case conjectural.

At equal rank use Ψ(s,W°,W′°,Φ°). At ramified π and spherical π′ the essential/newform test uses the conductor-dependent Φ of Humphries (3.10), not blindly 1_{O^n}.

### Fourier reconstruction and ordinary multiplicity one


<a id="gln-fourier-expansion"></a>

**The GL(n) cuspidal Fourier expansion.** For a smooth cuspidal φ of GL_n(𝔸_K), n≥2, define W_φ(g)=∫_{N_n(K)\N_n(𝔸_K)}φ(ug)ψ_N(u)⁻¹du, with quotient volume 1. Then φ(g)=Σ_{γ∈N_{n−1}(K)\GL_{n−1}(K)}W_φ(diag(γ,1)g), with locally uniform absolute convergence in the smooth cuspidal setting. In particular φ↦W_φ is injective and equivariant. Global genericity and factorization are subsequent consequences, not hypotheses of this expansion.

Assume: K is a number field in Cogdell Lecture 4; use a nontrivial global additive character and AF.3 smooth cuspidality/rapid decay. The same successive compact-unipotent Fourier argument gives the function-field version used in Yu §5.3.1; that source invokes Fourier reconstruction before factorization. At infinite places use smooth moderate-growth globalizations and the derivative estimates needed for the stated convergence. A vanishing cuspidal constant term is essential.

API:

- `AL3.GlnFourierExpansion.injective`: W_φ=W_φ′ implies φ=φ′ for smooth cusp forms with the fixed character and measure.
- `AL3.GlnFourierExpansion.equivariant`: W_{R(h)φ}(g)=W_φ(gh).

<a id="global-whittaker-factorization"></a>

**Global Whittaker factorization.** For a cuspidal π of GL_n(𝔸_K), Fourier reconstruction makes φ↦W_φ an injective Whittaker realization; hence π and every local component are generic. With quotient volume 1, continuous local Whittaker uniqueness and a fixed Flath restricted tensor realization, a factorizable φ has W_φ=∏_v W_v, after fixing one global scalar; almost all W_v are normalized spherical. At infinite places extend continuously from dense tensors. An arbitrary global cusp vector or distribution is not asserted decomposable.

Assume: π is an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation with AF.2 Flath factorization. Its global genericity is proved from gln-fourier-expansion, not requested from AF.3. At infinite places use the continuous Whittaker functional on the smooth moderate-growth globalization; uniqueness of arbitrary algebraic functionals on the Harish–Chandra module is not the theorem. The function-field spherical specialization is Yu §5.3.1.

API:

- `AL3.GlobalWhittakerFactorization.generic`: Every irreducible cuspidal π and its local components possess a nonzero Whittaker functional for the fixed nontrivial character.

<a id="global-multiplicity-one"></a>

**Ordinary global multiplicity one for GL(n).** For an irreducible admissible smooth representation π of GL_n(𝔸_K), K a number field, its multiplicity in the smooth cuspidal spectrum with fixed central character is at most one. If π is cuspidal, the multiplicity is one: any two nonzero equivariant embeddings into that cusp space differ by a nonzero scalar and have the same image. This is the ordinary multiplicity theorem; it assumes the same global representation, rather than cofinite local agreement.

Assume: n≥1; K a number field; characteristic-zero complex automorphic forms. Work with the unitary central-character Hilbert realization or an explicitly fixed norm twist. Use continuous equivariant embeddings and continuous Whittaker functionals on the smooth moderate-growth globalizations at infinity. Compare smooth and Hilbert cusp multiplicities by the dense smooth-vector realization in AF.3’s cuspidal Hilbert subspace, using AF.1 globalization and AF.2 restricted tensors. Prove this comparison here as part of the multiplicity theorem.

API:

- `AL3.GlobalMultiplicityOne.embeddings`: Two nonzero equivariant embeddings of π into the fixed smooth cusp space differ by c∈ℂ×.
- `AL3.GlobalMultiplicityOne.same_image`: The ranges of those two embeddings coincide.

Tests:

- `AL3.GlobalMultiplicityOne.level_dimension`: Even when dim π^K=2, the contribution at level K has dimension 2 while the global automorphic multiplicity is 1.

Assume: K is a number field; the function-field statements are established in the separate curve-cohomological subsection below. Unitarize the central characters consistently; every excluded finite and archimedean local factor is nonzero and finite at s=1, by the local unitary bounds and gamma calculation.

**Strong multiplicity one for isobaric sums.** Given AF’s existence/classification of isobaric sums π=⊞_iτ_i, equality of unramified components almost everywhere determines the multiset of cuspidal constituents τ_i, including multiplicities and norm twists. Thus two isobaric representations with those components are isomorphic. For arbitrary automorphic constituents the conclusion is equality of cuspidal support, not an unproved assertion that every constituent is itself the same representation.

Assume: K is a number field; the function-field statements are established in the separate curve-cohomological subsection below. Cuspidal support and normalized induction are supplied by AF.1/AF.3, with no duplicate classification here.

**The GL(n) converse theorem with twists through rank n−1.** For n≥2, under the stated niceness hypotheses for every cuspidal automorphic twist of each rank 1≤m≤n−1, Π is cuspidal automorphic. At n=2 the twisting family consists of all idele-class quasicharacters. The growth and archimedean hypotheses remain part of the niceness assumptions.

Assume: F is a number field; Π is an irreducible admissible restricted tensor representation of GL_n(𝔸_F), spherical almost everywhere, with idele-class central character and Euler products convergent in a right half-plane. Local factors, duals, additive character and archimedean conventions are fixed by AL.2–AL.3. For every indicated cuspidal twist τ, both completed L(s,Π×τ) and its contragredient partner have entire continuations bounded on finite vertical strips and the matching functional equation; these conditions are hypotheses, not consequences of automorphy of τ alone.

Checks: At n=2 the entire twisting family is all idele-class quasicharacters, with completed dual entireness, vertical-strip bounds and the matching functional equation. At n=3 the full-rank theorem requires both GL₁ and GL₂ cuspidal twists; dropping rank two is the separately proved reduced-rank theorem. A twist with an uncancelled pole violates niceness and cannot be passed to this converse theorem.

**The GL(n) converse theorem with twists through rank n−2.** For n≥3 and a finite set S of finite places, assume niceness for every cuspidal twist of rank 1≤m≤n−2 unramified at S. If S is empty, Π is cuspidal automorphic; otherwise an automorphic representation agrees with Π outside S. For n=3 these are GL₁ twists. This theorem gives no rank-two conclusion and no highly ramified-twist variant.

Assume: F is a number field; Π is an irreducible admissible restricted tensor representation of GL_n(𝔸_F), spherical almost everywhere, with idele-class central character and Euler products convergent in a right half-plane. Local factors, duals, additive character and archimedean conventions are fixed by AL.2–AL.3. For every indicated cuspidal twist τ, both completed L(s,Π×τ) and its contragredient partner have entire continuations bounded on finite vertical strips and the matching functional equation; these conditions are hypotheses, not consequences of automorphy of τ alone.

Checks: At n=3 and S=∅ all GL₁ twists satisfying niceness give cuspidal automorphy. Twists unramified at nonempty finite S give an automorphic representation matching outside S; neither cuspidality nor equality at S follows from this contract. n=2 is outside the hypotheses, so an empty range 1≤m≤0 yields no GL₂ theorem. Characters unramified at S are not the highly ramified T-family of Gelbart–Jacquet §9.2; that variant remains a separate proof obligation.

### Curve arithmetic and the unramified pure realization

The following inputs precede the polynomial theorems. They are separate mathematical results: the formal Euler product does not entail rationality, purity or its degree formula.

**Curve additive analysis.** Take K=𝔽_q(X), places, completions, differential residues and canonical divisors from Tau Ceti's **AlgebraicCurves**, layers 0, 4, 5, 9 and 12. Form completion-valued adeles with the existing restricted-product carrier; distinguish them from layer 4's K-valued repartitions. For nonzero ω and a nontrivial ψ₀:𝔽_q→Circle, define ψ_v(a)=ψ₀(Tr_(k(v)/𝔽_q) res_v(aω)). The residue theorem makes its product trivial on diagonal K. Prove its conductor is P_v^(−n_v), n_v=ord_v(ω); the existing canonical-divisor degree gives Σ_v n_v deg(v)=2g−2. Apply the finite-level Fourier proof to these completions and derive the topological discreteness/cocompactness and Schwartz/Poisson comparison from the existing Riemann–Roch quotient identities. The self-dual measures and global character are compatible with ω↦aω, a∈K×.

The `CurveAdditiveAnalysis` API supplies `residueCharacter_scale`, `fractionalIdeal_annihilator`, `conductor_degree`, `global_residue_product` and `poisson`. Tests: on ℙ¹, dt has divisor −2∞ and the conductor-degree sum is −2; two simple poles have opposite traced residues, giving a trivial product phase on diagonal constants; ω↦tω changes each n_v by ord_v(t), whose weighted sum is zero. Prerequisites: AlgebraicCurves's cited layers, SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.3, the existing restricted-product APIs, and AL.0's compact-open Fourier proof specialized to residue characters. Sources: Lafforgue, VI §1a–§1b, pp.152–157, Theorems VI.1, VI.2, VI.6 and VI.8; Yu, §5.3.1, pp.36–38.

**Rank-one unramified reciprocity.** Finite-order unramified idele-class characters factor through Pic(X); identify them with rank-one lisse π₁(X)-representations with prescribed geometric-Frobenius values. Use **JacobianChallenge** A, D–F for the Picard scheme, Jacobian and Abel map X→Pic¹. Prove the unramified finite-cover comparison: an abelian étale covering of X comes from the compatible finite cover of Pic¹ under that map, retaining the constant-field component. For J=Pic⁰, Fr_q−Id is a finite étale isogeny with kernel J(𝔽_q): its differential is −Id, and properness and connectedness give finiteness and surjectivity. Its torsor yields the degree-zero characters; the arithmetic constant-field quotient supplies degree characters. Pic¹ rather than a chosen rational point keeps the construction valid when X(𝔽_q) is empty. These identifications are inverse, with Frobenius/inverse-Artin convention fixed. This is the unramified GLₙ base case.

The `UnramifiedRankOneReciprocity` API gives `localPolynomial`, `tensor`, `dual`, `degreeTwist` and inverse maps. Tests: the trivial character gives the constant line; λ^deg(v) rotates the eigenvalue by λ^deg(v); inverse characters give dual lines. Prerequisites: the cited JacobianChallenge layers, SF.0–SF.2 finite-étale torsors and Frobenius, SF.3's Picard comparison, and the curve idele/divisor-class adapter. Sources: [Conrad, geometric class field theory](#ref-conradgeomcft), §3, Theorem 3.2, pp.3–4, specialized to zero modulus, with the Pic¹ distinction in §2, pp.2–3; Lafforgue, Theorem VI.9, pp.158–160. General ramified class field theory is outside this construction.

**Two-leg unramified shtukas.** For r≥1 and an 𝔽_q-scheme S, the object consists of rank-r vector bundles E,E′,E″ on X×S, injections E→E′ and E″→E′ with line cokernels on the graphs of the pole and zero S→X, and an isomorphism (Id_X×Frob_S)*E≅E″. Morphisms preserve this entire diagram. Construct the moduli stack and its Hecke correspondences. Its map to X×X is smooth of relative dimension 2r−2. Construct the two commuting partial Frobenius maps and their total-Frobenius composition; fixed-point comparisons use legs in distinct Frobenius orbits. Quotient by the central action of a degree-one idele, then use a sufficiently convex Harder–Narasimhan polygon to obtain finite-type truncations. Construct the specific no-level compactifications, smooth and proper over X×X with relative normal-crossing boundary.

The `TwoLegShtuka` API includes bundle/leg projections, diagram-preserving isomorphisms, `baseChange`, central degree translation, `partialFrobenius_commute`, `hecke_comp`, `truncation_inclusion` and `boundary_rank_partition`. Tests: rank one has relative dimension zero and determinant recovers its moduli problem; a rank-two boundary has rank-one graded pieces; enlarging a polygon gives an open inclusion preserving leg projections. Construct the no-level compactification by iterated-bundle degeneration. Prerequisites: Tau Ceti's **AlgebraicVectorBundles**, SF.1/SF.3, **AlgebraicModuliForArithmeticGeometry** R09.2–R09.5, and IHG.3/AF.1's Hecke data. Sources: Lafforgue, Definitions I.1–I.2, pp.17–18, I §1c–§2, pp.19–27, and the no-level compactification on pp.4–6.

**Essential cohomology and local factors.** Fix ℓ≠char(𝔽_q), an identification of algebraic coefficient fields in ℂ and Q̄_ℓ, and finite-order central character. Construct the rational ℓ-adic cohomology of these particular finite-stabilizer compactifications by descent from scheme charts; prove compatibility with finite-group invariants, Künneth, proper base change, trace and purity. The rational-coefficient hypothesis makes finite-group invariants exact. A constituent on the two-leg base is r-negligible when it is a direct summand of an external tensor product of lisse irreducibles of ranks strictly below r; retain its complement in the semisimplification.

Prove the proper unstable-open fixed-point comparison for these compactifications: for a correspondence generated by its dense Deligne–Mumford open part, étale first projection there and preservation of the open near its fixed points, sufficiently large compatible Frobenius iterates have stack-weighted fixed-point count equal to the alternating cohomological trace plus signed boundary-stratum traces. Local stabilization verifies the open-preservation hypothesis for the Hecke correspondences. Source: Lafforgue, Theorem IV.7, pp.97–99 and Theorem V.19, p.142 and proof pp.142–150; the no-level proper case in the remark on pp.188–189 uses this route.

The geometric targets are negligible boundary contributions, essential cohomology concentrated in degree 2r−2 and pure of weight 2r−2, and negligible kernels/cokernels under truncation change. Its finite-dimensional summand carries commuting Hecke and partial-Frobenius actions. Compute traces with the unramified t=0 truncated fixed-point formula: for distinct closed legs and sufficiently large equal total Frobenius degrees S, the cuspidal term is q^((r−1)S) times the sum over compatible cuspidal π of the Hecke trace, the inverse Satake power sum at the pole and the Satake power sum at the zero. Remaining terms are lower-rank products. Construct this counting comparison by double-coset/fixed-point and parabolic constant-term calculations before the purity conclusion. Hecke traces isolate the summand. Rank induction uses rank-one reciprocity, local/adelic zeta analysis and this counting formula, rather than the later polynomial/Riemann-hypothesis conclusions.

This yields the **unramified pure realization theorem**: for an everywhere-unramified cuspidal π of GLₙ(𝔸_K) with finite-order central character, there is an irreducible rank-n lisse Q̄_ℓ-sheaf V_π on X, with finite-order determinant, pure of weight zero, such that its geometric-Frobenius characteristic polynomial at every closed point agrees with the unitary Satake polynomial under the chosen coefficient identification. Conversely such irreducible lisse sheaves give the corresponding unramified cusp representation; uniqueness fixes dual and degree-character comparisons, and matching Frobenius polynomials identifies tensor local factors. Tensor products need not be irreducible and no cuspidal tensor transfer is asserted. For a general unitary central character, first remove a unitary degree character to reduce to finite order, then restore that character as a Weil-sheaf twist. An arbitrary unitary complex degree character is not silently treated as a continuous ℓ-adic Galois character.

The `UnramifiedPureRealization` API provides `rank`, `determinant_finiteOrder`, `pure_weight_zero`, `localPolynomial`, isomorphism invariance, `dual` and `degreeTwist`. Tests: rank one recovers reciprocity; the trivial line gives curve zeta factors; a self-pair with one degree self-twist has H⁰ eigenvalue 1 and H² eigenvalue q, while non-inertially-equivalent inputs have neither extreme group. Prerequisites: the preceding constructions and rank induction, SF.2 scheme trace/descent, EDC.0–EDC.2 and EDC.8, DWP.0/DWP.5–DWP.7, and AF.1/AF.3's cuspidal/Hecke realizations. Sources: Lafforgue, Theorem I.13, pp.31–32; VI.15–VI.22, pp.168–182; VI.24–VI.27, pp.184–191; Theorems VI.9–VI.10, pp.158–159.

**Tensor cohomological determinant.** For V=V_(π₁)⊗V_(π₂)∨, the formal Euler series equals ∏_(i=0)^2 det(1−z Fr_q|Hⁱ(X̄,V))^((−1)^(i+1)). The dimensions of H⁰ and H² and their Frobenius eigenvalues are computed from geometric invariants, not from an assertion of rationality alone. Poincaré duality identifies H² with the dual invariant space twisted by (−1). If π₁ and π₂ are not related by a unitary degree character, both extremes vanish; for a self-pair with d degree-character self-twists they give the two cyclic factors 1−zᵈ and 1−(qz)ᵈ. The unramified Euler characteristic is (2−2g)n₁n₂, and purity places all H¹ roots at |z|=q⁻¹ᐟ². This proves the rationality, degree and root location used below. Prerequisites: the pure realization, SF.2, EDC.2, DWP.7 and the native reversed characteristic polynomial. Sources: Lafforgue, Theorems VI.1–VI.2, p.153; Yu, Proposition 6.1.1, pp.42–43.


### Cuspidal polynomials and self-pair reciprocity


<a id="function-field-rs-euler-product"></a>

**The function-field pair Euler product.** For everywhere-unramified discrete Π₁,Π₂ over the function field of a smooth geometrically connected projective curve X/F_q, define L(Π₁×Π₂∨,z)=∏_v∏_{i,j}(1−α_{v,i}β_{v,j}^(−1)z^(deg v))^(−1) first as a formal series with constant term1. Its rationality follows after the cuspidal/residual comparisons, rather than being part of a formal infinite-product definition.

Assume: Finite field q>1; finite number of points of each degree; β nonzero.

API:

- `AL3.FunctionFieldRsEulerProduct.constant`: The formal series has constant term1.
- `AL3.FunctionFieldRsEulerProduct.local`: The v factor is the determinant for α_v⊗β_v^(−1), with z raised to deg v.
- `AL3.FunctionFieldRsEulerProduct.unitary_conjugate`: For unitary Π₂ replace inverse Satake roots by conjugates as multisets.

Tests:

- `AL3.FunctionFieldRsEulerProduct.rank_one`: At degree d with α=2,β=3 the factor is (1−(2/3)z^d)^(−1).
- `AL3.FunctionFieldRsEulerProduct.degree_two`: A degree2 place contributes first in z², not z.
- `AL3.FunctionFieldRsEulerProduct.self_pair`: A rank-one self-pair has local factor (1−z^d)^(−1).

**Cuspidal pair degrees and poles over a function field.** Let π₁,π₂ be unitary everywhere-unramified cuspidal of ranks n₁,n₂, g=genus X, and write L=P/Q with P(0)=Q(0)=1 and P,Q coprime. If ranks differ or π₁,π₂ are not inertially equivalent then Q=1 and deg P=(2g−2)n₁n₂. In the self-pair rank n case, with d=|Fix(π)|, Q=(1−z^d)(1−(qz)^d) and deg P=(2g−2)n²+2d; ε=q^((g−1)n²). Unit-modulus inertial twists rotate z.

Assume: Inertial equivalence means twisting by an unramified degree character; not literal equality.

### Residual products, telescoping and open-disc indices


<a id="residual-rs-product"></a>

**The residual Rankin–Selberg product.** Given AF’s discrete residual Π₁=π₁⊠ν₁ and Π₂=π₂⊠ν₂ in unitary normalization, L(Π₁×Π₂∨,z)=∏_{i=1}^{ν₁}∏_{j=1}^{ν₂}L(π₁×π₂∨,q^((ν₁+ν₂)/2+1−i−j)z). The ranks of Π_k are n_kν_k, where n_k is the cusp rank.

Assume: ν₁,ν₂ positive integers; everywhere-unramified function-field representations. Residual classification belongs to AF, not AL.

**Telescoping the residual normalizing quotient.** If ν₁≥ν₂, L(Π₁×Π₂∨,z)/L(Π₁×Π₂∨,q^(−1)z)=∏_{i=1}^{ν₂}L(π₁×π₂∨,q^((ν₁+ν₂)/2−i)z)/∏_{i=1}^{ν₂}L(π₁×π₂∨,q^(−(ν₁+ν₂)/2+i−1)z).

Assume: Equality of nonzero rational functions; the two products include their possible cancellations.

Source: [Yu](#ref-yu2023), (6.1.5), p.44.

Uses: [The residual Rankin–Selberg product](#residual-rs-product).


<a id="open-disc-zero-pole-index"></a>

**The open-disc zero–pole index.** For nonzero P,Q∈ℂ[z], define I(P/Q)=Σ_{a∈P.roots, |a|<1}1−Σ_{b∈Q.roots, |b|<1}1, counting multiplicities. This is independent of the rational presentation, since common roots cancel. It is N(f)−P(f) in the open unit disc; boundary roots are excluded. Use native meromorphic divisor/order APIs for the comparison.

Assume: P,Q are nonzero; the zero function is excluded and roots carry multiplicity.

API:

- `AL3.OpenDiscZeroPoleIndex.presentation`: PQ′=P′Q implies equal indices for nonzero denominators.
- `AL3.OpenDiscZeroPoleIndex.mul`: I(fg)=I(f)+I(g) for nonzero rational functions.
- `AL3.OpenDiscZeroPoleIndex.inv`: I(1/f)=−I(f).
- `AL3.OpenDiscZeroPoleIndex.divisor`: I(f) equals the sum of its finite native divisor in |z|<1.

Tests:

- `AL3.OpenDiscZeroPoleIndex.inverse_coordinate`: I(1/z)=−1.
- `AL3.OpenDiscZeroPoleIndex.boundary_excluded`: I(z−1)=0 since1 lies on the boundary.

<a id="residual-rs-index"></a>

**The residual zero–pole index.** For unitary everywhere-unramified Π₁=π₁⊠ν₁,Π₂=π₂⊠ν₂ with ν₁≥ν₂, the open-disc index of L(z)/L(q^(−1)z) is ν₂(2g−2)n₁n₂ plus d=|Fix(π₁)| precisely when Π₁ and Π₂ are inertially equivalent (equivalently ν₁=ν₂ and π₁ inertially equivalent to π₂); otherwise there is no d term.

Assume: Inertial twists have unit-modulus degree parameter, so they rotate roots without changing this index. The extra term depends on inertial equivalence, including nontrivial degree twists, rather than equality of representations.

### Scalar normalizers and conductor shifts


<a id="rs-normalizing-scalar"></a>

**The Rankin–Selberg normalizing scalar.** For a positive root β joining residual blocks Π_i,Π_j of ranks N_i,N_j over X/F_q, put n_β(z)=q^((1−g)N_iN_j)L(Π_i×Π_j∨,z)/L(Π_i×Π_j∨,q^(−1)z). The scalar for a Weyl element is the product over its positive inversion roots, with the corresponding character ratios substituted for z. The actual intertwining operators remain with AA/AF.

Assume: Nonzero rational factors; equality is meromorphic/rational, not a value formula at poles.

API:

- `AL3.RsNormalizingScalar.root`: The single-root scalar is the displayed shifted-L quotient.
- `AL3.RsNormalizingScalar.identity_weyl`: The empty inversion product is1.
- `AL3.RsNormalizingScalar.weyl_product`: For length-additive Weyl products, inversion factors compose after character substitution.

Tests:

- `AL3.RsNormalizingScalar.one_root`: A simple reflection has exactly one root factor.
- `AL3.RsNormalizingScalar.pole_not_value`: If the numerator has a pole at z=1, the scalar is compared as a rational function, not by substituting a totalized pole value.

**Reflection of the self-pair normalizer.** For Π=π⊠ν, cusp rank r, f=|Fix(π)| and self-pair numerator P, define F(z)=∏_{i=1}^ν P(q^(−i)z)∏_{i=1}^ν(1−(q^iz)^f)∏_{i=1}^{ν−1}(1−(q^iz)^f). Then n_β(z)=−z^E F(1/z)/F(z), E=((2g−2)r²+4f)ν−f. F is a polynomial in z^f with no roots on |z|=1.

Assume: ν≥1; q>1 and the self-pair reflection/purity theorem. E is an integer, so this is a rational monomial identity.

Then W↦(g↦W(t_vg)) identifies the spherical ψ_v model with the conductor-zero ψ_v(ϖ_v^(−n_v)·) model. For a nonzero spherical W, W(t_v)≠0. For the differential-defined global character, Σ_v n_v deg v=2g−2.

### The periodic pole clearer


<a id="trivial-function-field-pole-clearer"></a>

**Clearing the trivial function-field poles.** For the trivial character over X/F_q, let ζ_X(s)=P_X(q^(−s))/((1−q^(−s))(1−q^(1−s))) and Λ(1,s)=q^((g−1)(s−1/2))ζ_X(s). Then q^(s−1/2)(1−q^(−s))(1−q^(1−s))Λ(1,s)=q^(g(s−1/2))P_X(q^(−s)) is entire and symmetric under s↦1−s. Its central derivatives are nonnegative by the paired-root argument; for g=0 it is1.

Assume: The curve-cohomological determinant theorem of AL.3 supplies the zeta numerator, reciprocity and root location. The number-field factor s(s−1) does not remove the periodic function-field poles.

### Whittaker/cohomological rational comparison


<a id="rational-period-comparison"></a>

**The rational-period comparison after choosing structures.** Given the specified Whittaker and cohomological E-rational structures for a cohomological cuspidal Π and a permissible real-place signature ε, and a fixed nonzero infinity cohomology vector defining F_Π^ε, normalize F_Π^ε by p^ε(Π)^(−1) to preserve those structures. The period is in C×/E×. Scaling the infinity vector by c scales the comparison and period by c; changing rational bases changes a representative by E×. Twisting by algebraic ξ changes the period class by G(ξ_f)^(n(n−1)/2) with the signature ε·ε_ξ.

Assume: Use Raghuram §2.5.2: Π∈Coh(G_n,μ∨) is regular algebraic cuspidal over a number field with the stated strongly pure weight. The permissible signature ε cuts out the one-dimensional bottom-degree archimedean cohomology line. E contains Q(μ) and Q(Π_f); for the twist comparison enlarge E to contain the character rationality field as well. Construct the comparison and Gauss twisting theorem from AF.4 finite-part rationality and the ALS.5 Betti/cohomological realizations. Require their actual E-structures and the chosen infinity comparison vector. This conditional comparison proves no critical-value algebraicity theorem. Under σ∈Aut(ℂ), use the corrected signature convention of Raghuram §2.5.2.5, not an undefined σ ε.

**Convergence of partial automorphic Euler products.** For a unitarizable automorphic π and finite-dimensional r as in Borel13.2, excluding ramified places gives L^S(s,π,r)=∏_{v∉S}P_{t_v,r}(q_v^(−s))^(−1), absolutely convergent for Re(s)>c(π,r). No general continuation or functional equation follows for arbitrary r.

Assume: Use a uniform Satake eigenvalue bound |eigenvalue r(t_v)|≤q_v^a and sum_v q_v^(−σ)<∞ for σ>1.

### Weil–Deligne normalization and factor operations


<a id="local-parameter-comparison"></a>

**Compatibility of local analytic factors with parameters.** For GL_n standard factors and GL_n×GL_m tensor factors, whenever an actual local Langlands parameter with L/ε compatibility is given, the analytic factors from AL.2/AL.3 equal the Weil–Deligne factors. At an unramified place this reduces to P=det(1−T Fr). For a general L-group r, ramified factors require an actual parameter and are not defined from a spherical class.

Assume: At infinity use AF.1’s archimedean LLC; at finite places assume the stated L/ε-compatible parameter comparison. R01.2 supplies finite-extension-of-ℚₚ factors with geometric Frobenius, reciprocity and monodromy invariants. The classical and Hilbert GL₂ comparisons here take an actually compatible arithmetic realization, away from the coefficient prime, as an input; they neither construct that realization nor assert general finite-place compatibility. Preserve the arithmetic normalization dictionary: the classical weight-k Euler factor uses M=ρ_f^∨ with geometric Frobenius and converts to unitary normalization by the (k−1)/2 shift. In the cited Hilbert instance WD(ρ_π) corresponds to Rec(π⊗|·|^(−1/2)), hence L(WD(ρ_π),s)=L(s−1/2,π). Neither input asserts an unshifted equality for ρ itself.

<a id="satake-factor-operations"></a>

**Functorial operations on unramified factors.** For invertible semisimple Satake operators with eigenvalues α_i and β_j, direct sum multiplies P, tensor product has P(T)=∏_(i,j)(1−α_iβ_jT), dual has P(T)=∏_i(1−α_i^(−1)T), and scalar twist c has P_c(T)=P(cT). Coefficient embeddings commute with these polynomial identities. These are factor comparisons, not assertions of automorphic transfers.

Assume: Actual L-group representations and normalized Satake classes are supplied; dual requires invertibility.

<a id="exterior-power-transfer-comparison"></a>

**Exterior-power factors after an established transfer.** Given an established exterior-power transfer Π^(j) of Π with unramified parameter wedge^j(t_v), its partial standard factor equals ∏_v∏_(I⊂{1,…,n},|I|=j)(1−(∏_(i∈I)α_(v,i))q_v^(−s))^(−1). For BCGP’s H¹ decomposition into GL_(n_i) constituents, arithmetic shifts are(1−n_i)/2 separately on each constituent; their exterior-power decompositions inherit those shifts.

Assume: The actual exterior-square/symmetric-square transfers and any tensor transfer used must be imported from their owners; no all-rank exterior transfer is assumed.

In Liu’s Sym^(n−1)H¹⊗Sym^nH¹ case the tensor weight is2n−1 and the motivic central point n corresponds to unitary1/2.

Assume: Require the actual local-global identification at every place compared; do not infer motivic purity or Galois compatibility from the analytic factor.

## AL.5 — Values, signs and finite corrections


### Imprimitive functions and leading terms


<a id="finite-euler-correction"></a>

**Finite Euler corrections at critical points.** For a finite set S and local polynomials P_v(T), define E_S(s)=∏_{v∈S}P_v(q_v^(−s)). The imprimitive value is L^S(s)=E_S(s)L(s) as a meromorphic identity. It can be evaluated at s₀ only with the relevant holomorphy/limit hypotheses.

Assume: q_v>1, P_v(0)=1; L includes the specified archimedean normalization.

API:

- `AL5.FiniteEulerCorrection.empty`: E_∅=1.
- `AL5.FiniteEulerCorrection.union`: For disjoint S,T, E_{S∪T}=E_S E_T.
- `AL5.FiniteEulerCorrection.value`: If both terms are holomorphic at s₀, L^S(s₀)=E_S(s₀)L(s₀).
- `AL5.FiniteEulerCorrection.orders`: ord_{s₀}(L^S)=ord_{s₀}(E_S)+ord_{s₀}(L).

Tests:

- `AL5.FiniteEulerCorrection.empty_set`: Removing no places preserves the value.
- `AL5.FiniteEulerCorrection.simple_exceptional_zero`: If E=1−p^(−s), then E(0)=0; division by E(0) cannot recover L(0).
- `AL5.FiniteEulerCorrection.double_exceptional_zero`: E=(1−p^(−s))² has order2 at0 and E″(0)=2(log p)².

<a id="euler-correction-leading-term"></a>

**The leading term of a finite Euler correction.** Let E and L be holomorphic near s₀, E have finite vanishing order m and L have finite order r. Then EL has order m+r and leading Taylor coefficient the product of the two leading coefficients. In particular if E(s₀)=0, E′(s₀)≠0 and L(s₀)≠0, (EL)′(s₀)=E′(s₀)L(s₀). For E(s)=1−a q^(−s) with a q^(−s₀)=1, E′(s₀)=log q.

Assume: q>1; zero functions require separate infinite-order cases. This is complex analytic comparison, not a p-adic exceptional-zero formula.

### Complex period and stabilization dictionary

The local GL₂ comparison takes an actual holomorphic newform f over ℚ of weight k+2, a complex embedding of its coefficient field, nonzero periods Ω⁺ and Ω⁻ and its proved critical-value algebraicity theorem. For a primitive finite-order character χ, fix the convention that the analytic twist is f⊗χ⁻¹ and the normalized value uses its primitive Gauss sum and sign χ(−1)(−1)^j. At s=j+1, 0≤j≤k, put N=(2πi)^(j+1)Ω^sign/(G(χ)j!), with all factors nonzero, and require L(f⊗χ⁻¹,j+1)/N to belong to the chosen coefficient field enlarged by the character values. The completed value is Γ∞(j+1)L(f⊗χ⁻¹,j+1), so division by Γ∞(j+1)N gives the same algebraic value. Conjugation acts on all coefficients, character values, Gauss sum and period representative together. This is a conditional comparison of actual complex values; it does not construct the periods or deduce algebraicity from a scalar division identity. Its critical-value hypotheses and rational period line are stated explicitly, with the classical finite and completed L-series supplied by Tau Ceti's modular L-function API. Source: Rodrigues Jacinto–Williams, Appendix B, Theorem B.1, pp.208–209, for the character, sign and conductor dictionary; the algebraicity theorem is an input. AL.3's rational-period comparison provides the compatible cohomological period class when those rational structures have been identified.

For p∤level(f), choose α≠0 with αβ=ε(p)p^(k+1). Define the **complex stabilization coefficient** a_α(n)=a(n)−β·1_(p|n)a(n/p), the coefficient formula for f_α=f−βf(pz). Its API gives coefficients at indices prime to p and at multiples of p, the factor relation

L(f_α,χ⁻¹,s)=(1−βχ⁻¹(p)p⁻ˢ)L(f,χ⁻¹,s)

in the absolute-convergence half-plane and then meromorphically, and compatibility with the chosen complex embedding. The relation uses multiplicativity of the character and absolute summability to reindex the L-series. Tests: a_α(1)=a(1) for p>1; if a(1)=1 and a(p)=α+β then a_α(p)=α; if χ has p-power conductor greater than one, its zero-extended value at p is zero and the twisted correction equals 1. Its normalization is fixed independently of any construction of a p-adic distribution. The ordinary interpretation additionally requires α to be a p-adic unit; the complex formula itself is defined for any nonzero refinement. Prerequisites: the native `LSeries`/`LSeriesSummable` APIs, the modular coefficient and Hecke relations already in Tau Ceti, and AL.5's finite Euler correction. Source: Rodrigues Jacinto–Williams, Appendix B, pp.207–209, together with this coefficient reindexing argument. Substituting s=j+1 supplies exactly the second factor of `OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor`; the p-level interpolation expression supplies the first.


### Critical-value and sign interfaces


<a id="critical-value-period-interface"></a>

**The critical-value and period interface.** For a holomorphic GL₂/ℚ cohomological cusp representation, take the nonzero period line and actual critical-value algebraicity theorem specified in the complex dictionary. At a critical point with nonzero finite archimedean gamma value, write C=γF and use the full nonzero normalization N from the dictionary. Given F/N∈E, the comparison gives C/(γN)=F/N∈E. Transport the identity through the chosen coefficient embedding with the primitive-character, Gauss-sum, sign and motivic/unitary conventions fixed. This conditional comparison transports the normalized value’s membership in the supplied coefficient field; the algebraicity theorem is an input.

Assume: γ≠0, N≠0, C=γF and the actual input theorem F/N∈E; the critical point avoids gamma poles. The GL₂/ℚ algebraicity theorem fixes parity, primitive characters and Gauss sums as in the complex period dictionary above. The stated ℚ theorem has no general-number-field conclusion.

<a id="central-sign-vanishing"></a>

**The functional-equation sign at the centre.** If the conductor-balanced completed L-function is holomorphic at1/2, self-dual, and satisfies Λ(s)=−Λ(1−s), then Λ(1/2)=0. More generally its first nonzero Taylor term at the centre has parity determined by the root number. If the gamma value is finite and nonzero, the same vanishing order holds for the finite L-function.

Assume: Self-duality identifies both sides without an extra conjugation or twisting; the root number is ±1.

### Refined GL₂ Euler factors and conductor tests


<a id="ordinary-gl2-euler-factor"></a>

**The ordinary GL₂ interpolation factor.** For a good prime p, weight k+2, nebentypus ε and chosen nonzero refinement α with β=ε(p)p^(k+1)/α, define E_p(χ,j)=(1−χ(p)p^j/α)(1−χ^(−1)(p)ε(p)p^(k−j)/α), 0≤j≤k. A ramified p-power character is extended byχ(p)=χ^(−1)(p)=0, so E_p=1. The conductor-normalized prefactor α^(−ν) for condχ=p^ν is separate.

Assume: Use the complex character/period/Gauss dictionary stated in AL.5; the two-factor expression uses the good-prime newform, whereas the p-level eigenform has the first factor only.

API:

- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.ramified`: For ν>0 both local character values are0 and E_p=1.
- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.unramified`: For χ=1 use the displayed two-factor product.
- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.refinement`: Changing α changes β and the Euler correction; the unrefined form alone does not determine E_p.
- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.newform`: The p-level eigenform formula has only the first factor; the primitive newform adds the second factor after the character dictionary.

Tests:

- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.trivial_weight_two`: k=j=0,χ=1,ε(p)=1 gives(1−1/α)².
- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.ramified_weight_two`: A conductor-p character gives E_p=1, with the separate prefactorα^(−1).
- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.exceptional`: α=1,k=j=0 gives E_p=0; it cannot be canceled.
- `AL5.OrdinaryGl2EulerFactor.different_roots`: For p=3,k=j=0, ε(p)=1 and Hecke polynomial X²+3, the refinements α=±i√3 are both valid roots and give distinct corrections (1−1/α)².

<a id="local-conductor-test-vector-comparison"></a>

**Conductor and test-vector compatibility.** For generic irreducible π of GL_n(F) with conductor-zero ψ, the degree in q^(−s) of the standard epsilon monomial is c_π, the imported generic newform conductor. The GJ normalized newform integral realizes L(s,π). At a good GL₂ place, twisting an unramified π by a ramified character χ of conductorν>0 gives L(s,π⊗χ)=1 and conductor2ν. At rank1 it gives L=1 and conductorν.

Assume: The GL₂ twist assertion uses an unramified generic representation; it is not a formula for arbitrary already-ramified π. Nonzero newform normalization and compatible measures are required.
