# Roadmap: general algebraic K-theory

Build algebraic K-theory of small exact and Waldhausen categories, compare the Q, plus and S constructions, and prove additivity, resolution, localization and approximation. For associative rings, develop products, transfers, relative and nonunital theory, the ring projective line, Nil terms and the Bass Fundamental Theorem. Construct the nonconnective theories of rings and Frobenius models, compare them through finite domination, and identify precisely which enhancements are required for derived invariance.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns higher categorical K-theory and the negative extensions needed for those results. It includes the categorical homotopy tools, sequential spectrum interface, stable general linear group, elementary subgroup and projective patching used in its proofs. These are shared foundations: consumers use these constructions with their stated hypotheses.

Exact structures, conflations, admissible maps, exact functors, projective and injective objects, and Frobenius exact categories belong to Tau Ceti. Its exact Grothendieck groups, finite-projective exact categories and Cartan map are inputs here. The new conflation-category target equips the supplied category of conflations with its componentwise exact structure; it does not construct that underlying category again. GrothendieckEulerForms Layers 2–3 supply the algebraic degree-zero Euler and finite-resolution comparisons; the resolution theorem here adds the homotopy equivalence and all higher groups.

AlgebraicTopology Stages 2, 4 and 8 supply local coefficient complexes, CW attachment and the homotopy/Hurewicz/Whitehead tools. The new statements in Layer 1 concern categorical realizations, acyclic plus maps, spectra and their K-theoretic comparisons. Mathlib supplies simplicial sets, nerves, their realization and ordinary homotopy groups. Serre quotient categories and their abelian universal properties are supplied by Mathlib; Layer 4 proves their K-theory localization sequence.

DGAInfinity Layers 5–7 own perfect differential graded models, pretriangulated hulls, derived Morita theory and differential graded quotients. Layer 13 uses these carriers only to compare K-theory under an actual map of enhanced models. Triangulated structures, Verdier localization and idempotent completion are supplied category theory. The K-theoretic dense-class and completion criteria here add their Euler-class and boundary conclusions.

KTheoryLowDegrees consumes the degree-zero and degree-one adapters and stable matrices here. K2SymbolsBrauer owns field-specific symbol presentations, including Matsumoto’s theorem. K3BlochGroups owns the infinite-field indecomposable K₃ comparison. No Bloch-group presentation of K₃ for arbitrary rings is claimed. Scheme K-theory, descent, arithmetic calculations, topological K-theory and a general theory of commutative ring spectra remain separate directions; the projective-line construction here is stated directly for rings.

## Conventions

A ring is associative and unital unless it is explicitly nonunital; ordinary ring maps preserve the unit. Polynomial variables are central. Ideals of a noncommutative ring are two-sided. Write P(R) for finite projective left modules. Right-module arguments use Rᵒᵖ and the duality comparison; this is essential for the idempotent extension and projective-line formulas. No invariant-basis-number, flatness or noetherian hypothesis is implicit. When regularity is used for vanishing, the stated sufficient scope is left noetherian with finite left global dimension.

Categories and diagrams are small in a specified universe. An essentially w-small exact category is replaced by a w-small exact model before taking Q, a nerve or homotopy groups; model independence is a theorem, not a choice of universe equality. All equivalences and natural transformations used for transport preserve the indicated exact or Waldhausen structures. The zero object supplies the basepoint.

Set K(C)=ΩBQC for exact C, and K_n(C)=π_{n+1}BQC for n≥0. For Waldhausen C, set K(C)=Ω|NwS•C|. The connective spectrum has no negative groups. Bass K_{−n}=LⁿK₀, n≥0, and the nonconnective spectra are built later to recover these groups. A homotopy-fibre sequence includes its nullhomotopy. Exactness at degree zero uses pointed sets unless a grouplike structure has already supplied groups.

Fix localization boundaries by [coker α]−[ker α]. A DVR uniformizer therefore has boundary +[k]. A relative triple (P,α,Q) has difference [P]−[Q]. Milnor clutching uses α from the second chart to the first, so x̄=α(ȳ). Projective-line gluing instead goes from the plus chart to the minus chart and twist n multiplies that gluing by t^{−n}. These two gluing conventions concern different categories.

For Laurent splitting use {t,x} with the t-class first; its boundary is x. Graded interchange contributes (−1)^{pq}; odd squares are only proved to be killed by 2. Finite chain Euler classes are alternating sums, with degree zero positive. Each of these conventions has a computed check below. Sequential spectra are used through their derived fibre, cofibre and pairing interface; binary pairings alone do not supply an E∞ structure.

## Exact supplier contracts

### From Mathlib

Use `CategoryTheory.nerve` and `nerveMap`, `SSet.toTop`, `SSet.toTopSimplex` and `sSetTopAdj` for realization. Use `Path`, `ContinuousMap.Homotopy`, `ContinuousMap.HomotopyEquiv`, `LoopSpace` and `HomotopyGroup.Pi` for spaces and their based homotopy. These declarations do not themselves provide Quillen A/B, the plus construction or the spectrum comparisons; Layer 1 states those additional results.

Use `ShortComplex`, kernels, cokernels, pullbacks, pushouts, biproducts and additive functors. The exact square arguments retain `IsPullback`/`IsPushout` witnesses. `CategoryTheory.Idempotents.Karoubi` supplies actual idempotents; a map idempotent only up to chain homotopy is not such an object. Use homological complexes and chain homotopies, triangulated object properties and Verdier localizations as their existing carriers.

For a Serre object property P, use `P.isoModSerre.Localization` and its functor `P.isoModSerre.Q`. In `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.SerreClassLocalization`, use `abelian`, `isZero_obj_iff`, `isIso_map_iff`, `preservesFiniteLimits`, `preservesFiniteColimits` and `exactFunctor_comp_iff`: the quotient is abelian, kills precisely P, inverts precisely the maps with P-kernel and P-cokernel, and has the exact-functor universal property. The calculus-of-fractions hypotheses come from `P.IsSerreClass`.

For rings and modules use `ModuleCat`, finite generation and projectivity, finite `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup`, elementary matrix algebra, `RingHom.pullback`, `Polynomial`, `LaurentPolynomial`, `IsNilpotent`, tensor products and `Unitization ℤ I`. Commutative `ModuleCat.extendScalars` is used in its actual commutative scope; Layer 3 supplies the general associative bimodule extension. Use `MoritaEquivalence` for an R-linear module equivalence over a commutative base semiring R, and `ModuleCat.matrixEquivalence` for rings and a finite nonempty matrix index. Stable GL and its Whitehead subgroup theorem are new.

### From Tau Ceti

Use `TauCeti.ExactStructure`, its `Conflation`, `IsInflation`, `IsDeflation`, exact base-change axioms and `IsConflationExact`. An additive functor preserving conflations is the exact-functor input. Use `ExactStructure.transport` for the supplied exact-structure transport. `ConflationCategory` and its three evaluation functors supply the underlying category in §4.2.

Use `TauCeti.ExactK0`, `ExactK0.of`, `ExactK0.map`, `ExactK0.of_conflation` and its split comparison. The construction is available for essentially small exact categories. Use `finiteProjectiveModules`, `finiteProjectiveModulesExactStructure`, `finiteProjectiveModulesExactStructure_eq_split` and the existing Cartan map; these fix both the ring K₀ carrier and its generators.

Use `ExactStructure.IsFrobenius` with enough projectives, enough injectives and equality of the projective and injective classes, and its stable triangulation. The current bounded-complex Frobenius structures identify contractibles as the projective-injectives; admissible acyclicity and homotopy-acyclicity remain distinct. The new object of §11.1 is a pair of these structures and its derived quotient, not another Frobenius predicate.

The current `CategoryTheory.Equivalence.finiteProjectiveModulesEquivalence` and `isConflationExact_finiteProjectiveModulesEquivalence_functor` supply Morita restriction and its exactness; `finiteProjectiveModulesK0Equiv` supplies its degree-zero map. `IsIdempotentElem.cornerEquivalence` supplies the module equivalence for a full idempotent, with fullness `TwoSidedIdeal.span {e}=⊤`. The new corner results compare higher and negative K-maps; the general nonunital functor also allows non-full h(1).

### From TauCetiRoadmap

AlgebraicTopology Stage 2 supplies local coefficient chain complexes and their homology, Stage 4 the CW constructions and replacements, and Stage 8 relative homotopy exactness, Hurewicz and simply connected Whitehead. Plus uniqueness with a nontrivial fundamental group is proved here using universal covers and pulled-back local coefficients, rather than being inferred from ordinary integral homology alone.

GrothendieckEulerForms Layer 2 supplies degree-zero exact Euler relations and Layer 3 the resolving-subcategory Euler comparison. DGAInfinity Layer 5 supplies perfect/pretriangulated differential graded models, Layer 6 their derived Morita comparison and Layer 7 the differential graded quotient. The higher and nonconnective K-comparison requires an enhanced functor satisfying approximation or the Frobenius-pair derived-equivalence theorem; it does not follow from these suppliers’ bare triangulated equivalences.

## How to read the build

Layer 1 supplies homotopy tools for Q-theory (Layer 2) and the ring/plus comparison (Layer 3). Layer 4 gives exact additivity, resolution and Serre localization. Layers 5–6 construct and deloop S-theory, then prove fibration, approximation and cofinality with cylinders or existential factorizations. Products and transfers (Layer 7) precede relative theory (Layer 8) and projective-line/Nil arguments (Layer 9). Bass groups and their spectrum (Layer 10) are compared with Frobenius and controlled-cone theory (Layers 11–12). Layer 13 proves continuity and compatibility, then exhibits the limits of bare triangulated invariance.

## Layer 1: Categorical homotopy tools

### 1.1 Homotopies from functors

For small C,D, set BC=|nerve C|. A natural transformation F→G gives BF≃BG through C×[1]; equivalences realize to homotopy equivalences. Initial, terminal, or nonempty filtered categories have contractible realization; finite diagrams have cones in the filtered case. Prove composition, finite-product and opposite comparisons, and filtered continuity on homotopy groups. Prove finite-poset detection: if every finite-poset functor into C realizes to a nullhomotopic map, BC is contractible, by finite sphere triangulations, face-poset subdivision and CW Whitehead.

(Weibel IV, §3.1–3.3, pp.IV.24–27;§6.4, pp.IV.55–56;Schlichting 2003, Appendix A.10, p.27.)

Use:

- `classifyingSpace_natTrans`: cylinder homotopy has endpoints BF and BG.
- `classifyingSpace_equivalence`: An equivalence realizes to a homotopy equivalence.
- `classifyingSpace_filtered`: Nonempty filtered categories have contractible realization.
- `classifyingSpace_product`: comparison for a finite product is a homotopy equivalence.
- `classifyingSpace_op`: Reversing simplices gives the opposite-category comparison.

**Checks.**

- A one-object category with only its identity realizes to a point.
- The discrete category on two objects has two components and is not contractible.
- For [1], either endpoint inclusion is a homotopy equivalence; a category with a zero object is therefore contractible even if it has many morphisms.

*Needs:* Mathlib nerve, realization, paths and homotopy groups; the space-level suppliers in Scope and ownership.

### 1.2 Based homotopy fibres

For based f:X→Y, define its fibre by (x,γ), γ:y₀⇝f(x), with topology induced from X×C([0,1],Y) and point (x₀,const y₀). Construct projection, strict-square maps and transport for homotopy squares with specified homotopy. Prove homotopy exact sequence, retaining pointed sets at degree zero; grouplike H-space maps supply group laws there. A fibre sequence includes its composite nullhomotopy.

(Weibel IV, Homotopy Fiber 1.2, pp.IV.3–4.)

Use:

- `HomotopyFibre`: path-pair subspace and its distinguished point.
- `HomotopyFibre.map`: commuting based square induces the path-pair map.
- `HomotopyFibre.boundary`: connecting map with the path direction specified above.
- `HomotopyFibre.exact`: exact sequence, group-valued only in the stated degrees.

**Checks.**

- The fibre of id_X is contractible, even when X is disconnected.
- The fibre of point→Y is ΩY at y₀.
- For X→point the fibre is homotopy equivalent to X; for the inclusion of one point into a discrete two-point space it is a point, not all of the target.

*Needs:* Mathlib nerve, realization, paths and homotopy groups; the space-level suppliers in Scope and ownership.

### 1.3 Bisimplicial realization and subdivision

Compare diagonal and iterated bisimplicial realization. Level weak equivalences induce total weak equivalences, hence homotopy equivalences for CW realizations. For a map to a category nerve, constant in the second direction, base-change equivalences identify the fibres with realized homotopy fibres. Define edgewise subdivision by [n]↦[n]^op⋆[n] and prove its realization homeomorphism. The horizontal-isomorphism/all-vertical-map double nerve realizes equivalently to the ordinary nerve by contracting the isomorphism direction. For proper simplicial CW spaces, prove the connected realization-fibration criterion used by relative S: level fibre squares have connected bases and totals, with coherent fibre identifications.

(Weibel IV, D 3.6 and T 3.6.1, pp.IV.29–30;Example 3.10.1, pp.IV.33–34;§8.5.1, pp.IV.69–70;Waldhausen, §1.6, pp.343–346;§1.5, proof of the relative-S delooping, pp.339–341.)

Use:

- `bisimplicialRealization`: Iterated realization with a natural diagonal comparison.
- `edgewiseSubdivision`: Precomposition by the ordered join functor.
- `edgewiseSubdivision_homeomorph`: canonical realization homeomorphism.
- `isomorphismDoubleNerve`: horizontal-isomorphism double nerve and its comparison map.

**Checks.**

- A constant bisimplicial singleton realizes to a point in both models.
- The diagonal of a constant discrete two-point bisimplicial set has two components; no contractibility conclusion is available.
- For a one-arrow category the subdivision bisects its interval, rather than turning it into a circle.

*Needs:* Mathlib nerve, realization, paths and homotopy groups; the space-level suppliers in Scope and ownership.

### 1.4 Comma categories and Quillen’s criteria

For F:C→D, contractible d↓F for every d implies BF is a homotopy equivalence (A). If every d→d′ gives an equivalence B(d′↓F)→B(d↓F), B(d↓F) computes the fibre over d (B). Prove dual F↓d criteria. Cartesian lifts of a prefibred functor identify strict fibres with comma categories; fibre base changes must be equivalences to conclude fibration. Strict-fibre contractibility alone does not suffice.

(Weibel IV, T 3.7 and 3.8, C 3.7.4, pp.IV.30–32;Quillen, §1, T A and B, pp.93–97.)

**Checks.**

- An adjoint supplies contractible comma categories and recovers an equivalence of classifying spaces.
- The inclusion of one object into a discrete two-object category has an empty comma category at the other object and fails Theorem A.
- A strict fibre may be empty while its comma category is nonempty: include the initial vertex of [1] and use the slice over the terminal vertex.

*Needs:* §1.1–1.3 and Mathlib comma categories and adjunctions.

### 1.5 Acyclic maps and the plus construction

For connected based CW X and perfect normal P⊂π₁X, construct X→X_P⁺ with kernel P and acyclic homotopy fibre. Acyclic means integral homology of a point, equivalently preservation of all target local coefficients pulled back to X. Prove uniqueness under X and coherent functoriality for maps preserving the subgroup data, using functorial cell attachment or localization. Killing P and ordinary homology preservation alone do not characterize plus; no factorization into an arbitrary target killing P is claimed.

(Weibel IV, D 1.3–1.4.1, T 1.5(1),(3), L 1.6, pp.IV.4–6.)

Use:

- `PlusConstruction`: target, based map, acyclic-fibre proof and prescribed kernel.
- `PlusConstruction.pi1`: induced fundamental group is π₁X/P.
- `PlusConstruction.localHomology`: Preservation of pulled-back local homology.
- `PlusConstruction.map`: Maps of the chosen subgroup data induce plus maps, with coherent composition.

**Checks.**

- For P=1 the map is a homotopy equivalence.
- If π₁X is perfect, X⁺ is simply connected, but nonzero H₂(X;ℤ) prevents it from being contractible.
- For π₁X=ℤ the only perfect subgroup is zero, so plus cannot kill the fundamental class of the circle.

*Needs:* §1.2; AlgebraicTopology Stages 2, 4 and 8 for local coefficient complexes, CW attachment and simply connected Whitehead; the universal-cover acyclicity argument belongs to this target.

### 1.6 Symmetric monoidal group completion

For a small symmetric monoidal groupoid S with faithful translations, construct S⁻¹S and S⁻¹X for an S-action. Objects are (s,x); morphisms are stabilized maps modulo common further translation. Construct equivariant maps and universal inversion. Prove π₀B(S⁻¹S) is the completion of π₀BS, with localized homology equal to group-completion homology. For a full symmetric monoidal T⊂S with every s admitting s′ and s⊕s′∈T, prove positive-group equivalence and degree-zero injection. This supplies plus/Q before Waldhausen cofinality. Define ⟨S,X⟩ by objects x and arrows (s,s⊕x→y), modulo isomorphism of s. If X-arrows are monic and Aut_S(s)→Aut_X(s⊕x) is injective, prove B(S⁻¹S)→B(S⁻¹X)→B⟨S,X⟩ is a fibre sequence. If translations already realize to equivalences, X→S⁻¹X is a homotopy equivalence.

(Weibel IV, D 4.2, 4.4, 4.7–4.7.1;T 4.8–4.11;E 4.5–4.7, pp.IV.37–46.)

Use:

- `MonoidalLocalization`: Pairs and stabilized-morphism equivalence classes.
- `MonoidalLocalization.action`: Functoriality for faithful actions and their equivariant maps.
- `MonoidalLocalization.pi0`: universal group-completion isomorphism.
- `MonoidalLocalization.cofinality`: Positive-degree equivalence and degree-zero injection for a cofinal inclusion.
- `MonoidalLocalization.actionFibration`: homotopy-fibre sequence under the monic and injective-translation hypotheses.

**Checks.**

- For the discrete monoid ℕ, π₀ of its completion is ℤ, so the map on components is not an equivalence.
- For a group viewed as a discrete monoidal groupoid, inversion changes no components.
- Finite free objects in projectives over k×k have diagonal degree-zero image in ℤ², despite positive cofinality.

*Needs:* §1.1–1.4; Mathlib symmetric monoidal categories, group completion and categorical localization.

### 1.7 Sequential spectra and stable exact sequences

Define prespectra by E_r with ΣE_r→E_{r+1}, adjointly E_r→ΩE_{r+1}. For integer j, stable π_j is colim_r π_{j+r}E_r over j+r≥2. Stable equivalences induce isomorphisms in all such degrees. Construct functorial spectrification by iterated loops and telescopes, preserving stable groups. CW replacements supply derived fibres, cofibres and sequential homotopy colimits. Prove fibre≃Ωcofibre, integer-graded exactness, and π_j(hocolim E_r)≃colim π_jE_r; finite stable products are coproducts. For Ω-spectra, π_j agrees with π_{j+r}E_r when j+r≥1; loop structure supplies component groups.

(May, Chapter 22 §§1–2, pp.176–178;Chapter 25 §§1,6–7, pp.220,230–233;Weibel IV, §10.1–10.2, pp.IV.79–80.)

Use:

- `Prespectrum`: Based spaces with adjoint structure maps and strict maps of those data.
- `Prespectrum.stableGroup`: colimit on the cofinal group-valued tail.
- `Prespectrum.spectrify`: An Ω-spectrum and a stable equivalence from the input.
- `Spectrum.fibre`: derived fibre with a chosen nullhomotopy and exact sequence.
- `Spectrum.cofibre`: derived mapping cone and its suspension relation to the fibre.
- `Spectrum.telescope`: Sequential homotopy colimit and homotopy-group continuity.

**Checks.**

- The zero prespectrum has zero groups in every integer degree.
- For the Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum Hℤ only π₀ is ℤ; for its desuspension Σ⁻¹Hℤ, π₋₁ is ℤ, so a negative degree cannot be replaced by degree zero.
- For a map E→0 the fibre is E and the cofibre is ΣE, fixing the shift direction.
- The telescope of Hℤ --2→ Hℤ --2→ … has π₀=ℤ[1/2]; its ordinary set-theoretic union is not a model unless embeddings have actually been chosen.

*Needs:* §1.1–1.2; AlgebraicTopology Stages 4 and 8 for CW replacements and homotopy-group exactness; May Chapter 22 for suspension, smash and telescope constructions.

### 1.8 Stable pairings and the sphere sign

Define prespectrum pairings by E_r∧F_s→G_{r+s} with suspension squares including sphere interchange. Construct stage-independent bilinear π_iE⊗π_jF→π_{i+j}G. Associativity and unit diagrams give the group identities. Symmetry interchanges spheres with degree (−1)^{ij}, including integer degrees. Extend pairings through spectrification and derived sequential colimits, retaining coherence; full E∞ algebra theory is separate.

(May, Chapter 25 §2, pp.221–223, ring-prespectrum definition and graded-ring lemma;Waldhausen, §1.5, p.342.)

Use:

- `PrespectrumPairing`: levelwise smash maps and their suspension coherence.
- `PrespectrumPairing.product`: bilinear degree-adding product on stable groups.
- `PrespectrumPairing.symmetry`: sphere-interchange identity, including negative integer degrees.

**Checks.**

- Exchanging two one-spheres acts by −1 on their two-sphere smash.
- Exchanging a one-sphere and a two-sphere acts by +1.
- An odd-degree square is annihilated by 2; it is not asserted to be zero without excluding 2-torsion.

*Needs:* §1.7; the degree computation for sphere interchange in this target; Mathlib tensor products of abelian groups.

### Examples

The discrete category on two objects detects a missing connectedness hypothesis. The fibre of point→Y is ΩY, whereas the fibre of id_Y is contractible. Interchanging two one-spheres has degree −1; interchanging a one-sphere and a two-sphere has degree +1.

### Dependencies

Mathlib nerves, geometric realization, paths and ordinary homotopy groups; the AlgebraicTopology supplier contracts.

## Layer 2: Quillen categories and connective groups

### 2.1 Exact categories and Quillen's category Q(A)

Construct `QCat E` on the objects of a small exact category. A map X → Y is a span X ↞ M ↣ Y, with the left arrow a deflation and the right arrow an inflation, modulo an isomorphism of M that fixes both endpoint maps. To compose X ↞ M ↣ Y and Y ↞ N ↣ Z, use M ×_Y N. The projections are respectively a deflation to M and an inflation to N; their composites give the new span. Prove representative independence and the category laws. Every Q-map factors as a reversed deflation followed by an inflation, uniquely up to an isomorphism of its middle object. Q-isomorphisms come precisely from isomorphisms of the original category. A map from zero is the same as an admissible subobject of its target. Interchanging subobjects and quotient objects identifies Q of the opposite exact category with Q of the original.

Use E0–E2 and their duals. Deflation base change supplies the pullback; the kernel–cokernel property and deflation composition supply the inflation leg. The obscure axiom retains its cokernel hypothesis, or kernel hypothesis dually. Span representatives and their quotient are small in one universe; §2.3 treats essentially small categories.

(Weibel IV, D 6.1;6.1.1, p.IV.53;6.1.2 (Subobjects) and the paragraph after it, p.IV.53;6.1, the paragraph on the two distinguished kinds of morphism, p.IV.53;Bühler, P 2.15, p.10, and P 2.16;Remark 2.17, pp.10–11 (arXiv v2);Weibel II, E 7.8, pp.II.70–71;Quillen, §2, pp.99–104.)

Use:

- `QCat`: category Q(A) attached to an exact structure.
- `QCat.hom_equiv_subobject`: Admissible subobject of the target with admissible epimorphism to the source.
- `QCat.inflation`: morphism attached to an admissible monomorphism.
- `QCat.deflation`: The reversed arrow of an admissible epimorphism.
- `QCat.factor`: Reversed-deflation/inflation normal form, unique up to middle isomorphism.
- `QCat.hom_zero`: Morphisms out of the zero object are the admissible subobjects.
- `QCat.isoQ_equiv_iso`: isomorphisms of Q(A) are those of A.
- `QCat.op`: Q of the opposite exact category is isomorphic to Q(A).

**Checks.**

- The spans 0 ↞ 0 ↣ V and 0 ↞ V ↣ V give respectively the zero and whole admissible subobjects of V. For a nonzero one-dimensional vector space these are distinct Q-arrows.
- In the split exact category of finitely generated abelian groups, ℤ → ℤ/2 is an epimorphism but is not a deflation; it cannot supply a Q-span.
- An invertible span has both legs invertible; an automorphism of V survives as a Q-automorphism.
- Taking the opposite interchanges the inflation and deflation factors without reversing the direction of the resulting Q-category equivalence.

*Needs:* `ExactStructure`; `ExactStructure.conflation_baseChange`; `ExactStructure.conflation_comp_of_isPullback`.

### 2.2 The universal property of Q(A)

Prove that a functor from Q(A) to D is specified by its object values, its covariant values on admissible inflations and its contravariant values on admissible deflations. Each assignment preserves identities and composition. For every admissible bicartesian square, the two induced composites agree. These conditions extend the assignments uniquely across the normal form of a Q-span. An additive functor preserving conflations consequently induces `QMap`, with identity, composition and natural-isomorphism compatibility.

A is small exact and D arbitrary; impose only admissible bicartesian-square relations from span composition.

(Weibel IV, 6.1, the factorisation, and 6.2, the proof, pp.IV.53–IV.54;Quillen, §2, pp.99–104.)

Use:

- `QCat.lift`: functor out of Q(A) determined by the data.
- `QCat.lift_inflation`: Its value on an inflation.
- `QCat.lift_deflation`: Its value on a deflation.
- `QCat.lift_unique`: Uniqueness of the functor.
- `QCat.map`: functor induced by an exact functor.

**Checks.**

- For the identity exact functor, the induced Q-map fixes the zero and whole Q-subobject arrows of k.
- The zero exact functor sends both arrows 0→k to the single identity of Q(0).
- The square (0→k, 0→0) with vertical maps id₀ and k→0 is not bicartesian: its two reversed-deflation/inflation composites are the distinct zero and whole subobject arrows.

*Needs:* §2.1.

### 2.3 Small models, transport of the exact structure and independence

Extend Q, BQ and the higher K-groups to essentially small exact categories by applying them to a small exact model. Prove independence of that model, and naturality for squares commuting up to an exact natural isomorphism. An additive equivalence preserving and reflecting conflations induces a Q-equivalence and a homotopy equivalence of classifying spaces. The result concerns Q and higher homotopy, beyond the algebraic transport of exact K₀.

For essentially w-small C, transport conflations to a w-small model; its Q, nerve, realization and groups are w-small. Ring projective models are u-small for R:Type u.

(Weibel IV, D 6.3.1 and the surrounding remark, p.IV.55.)

*Needs:* §2.1; `ExactStructure.transport`; `ExactK0.transportEquiv`; `ExactK0.mapEquiv`.

### 2.4 The fundamental group of the Q-construction is the Grothendieck group

Prove that BQ(E) is connected and that π₁(BQ(E),0) is the ExactK₀(E). The class of A is the loop that follows the inflation 0→A and returns along the reverse of the Q-arrow associated with A↠0. The triangle relations in the nerve impose [B]=[A]+[C] for each conflation A↣B↠C. Construct inverse using ExactK₀’s universal property and the covering associated with the functor from Q(E) to its one-object Grothendieck-group category; prove both composites on generators.

E is small, or transported by §2.3. Inflation followed by reversed deflation gives the positive loop; reversing both edges negates its class.

(Weibel IV, P 6.2 and proof, Example 6.2.3, p.IV.54;Quillen, §2, pp.99–104.)

*Needs:* §2.2; §2.3; Layer 1; `ExactK0`; `ExactK0.of`; `ExactK0.of_conflation`; `ExactK0.AdditiveInvariant`; `ExactK0.lift`; `ExactK0.liftEquiv`; `ExactK0.hom_ext`; `ExactK0.transportEquiv`; `CategoryTheory.nerve`; `SSet.toTop`; `HomotopyGroup`.

### 2.5 The K-groups of an exact category

Define BQ(E)=|nerve Q(E)| with its zero-object vertex as basepoint, KSpace(E)=ΩBQ(E), and K_n(E)=π_{n+1}BQ(E) for n≥0. Prove that these groups are commutative, including n=0 by §2.4. Construct maps for exact functors and prove that an exact natural isomorphism gives homotopic maps. Change of zero object and of small model gives the compatible canonical group isomorphisms. The equality π_nKSpace=π_{n+1}BQ includes π₀ as the component group of the loop space.

Keep the essential-small universe throughout; zero-object comparison isomorphisms give basepoint independence.

(Weibel IV, D 6.3, p.IV.54;Quillen, §2, pp.99–104.)

Use:

- `KSpace`: based loop space ΩBQ(A), whose π₀ is ExactK0(A).
- `KGroup`: π_n KSpace=π_{n+1}BQ.
- `KGroup.addCommGroup`: Commutative addition, including degree zero.
- `KGroup.map`: map induced by an exact functor.
- `KGroup.map_of_natIso`: Isomorphic exact functors induce the same map.
- `KGroup.zero_eq_exactK0`: The natural degree-zero comparison.

**Checks.**

- For finite-dimensional k-spaces, K₀=ℤ and [k]=1.
- The zero exact category has zero K_n for all n≥0.
- For k-spaces, BQ is connected but π₀KSpace=ℤ, including the virtual component −1.
- Opposite duality identifies K₀(k^op) with ℤ and takes [k] to 1.

*Needs:* §2.4; §2.3; `CategoryTheory.nerve`; `SSet.toTop`; `HomotopyGroup`.

### 2.6 Elementary properties: opposites, finite products and filtered colimits

Show that finite products of exact categories give products of Q-categories and K-groups, and that reversing the exact category leaves its K-groups unchanged. For a small filtered diagram of exact categories and exact functors, give its colimit the conflations that descend from a stage and prove continuity of K_n. Direct sum makes BQ a homotopy-commutative H-space; prove that its induced addition agrees with the homotopy-group operation. The colimit argument descends finite spans, their equations and finite representatives of homotopies to one stage.

Products are finite; check the filtered-colimit conflations against the exact axioms and exact-functor preservation.

*Needs:* §2.5; Layer 1; `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasFilteredColimits`.

### Examples

For finite-dimensional k-spaces, the two Q-arrows 0→k associated to the zero and whole subobject are distinct. Their two-edge loop gives [k]=1 in K₀(k). Although BQ is connected, its loop space has components indexed by ℤ.

### 3.1 Scalar extension as an exact functor of finitely generated projectives, without a flatness hypothesis

For a unital map f:A→B of associative rings, construct extension of scalars on modules as the left adjoint of restriction of scalars. Restrict it to finite projectives and prove preservation of finite generation, projectivity and split conflations. On left modules it is B⊗_A P; on right modules it is P⊗_A B. The identity and composite tensor isomorphisms satisfy the pseudofunctor coherence and induce functorial K-maps. This general-ring construction extends the commutative scalar-extension API; exactness on finite projectives requires no flatness.

Use unital ring maps and essentially small split-exact projective categories; extension on all modules need not be exact.

(Weibel, II.2.2–2.4, pp.70–73;IV.6.3.2, p.319;III.1.1.1, p.180.)

Use:

- `projBaseChange`: Unital associative scalar extension on finite projectives.
- `projBaseChange_exact`: Additivity preserves split conflations.
- `projBaseChange_id`: The tensor-unit natural isomorphism.
- `projBaseChange_comp`: The tensor-associativity natural isomorphism.
- `projBaseChange_comm`: Agreement with commutative ModuleCat.extendScalars.

**Checks.**

- ℤ→ℤ/2 is exact on split projectives despite non-flatness.
- Rⁿ extends to Sⁿ, including n=0.
- Extension along id_R returns P; extension along R→S→T agrees with direct extension.
- Tensoring ℤ --2→ ℤ with ℤ/2 gives the zero map, showing failure of monic preservation on all modules.
- For k→M₂(k), k extends to M₂(k), of Morita rank 2; the induced K₀ map is ×2.

### 3.2 The early ring model: functorial connective K-theory of unital rings

Apply the small-model Q-theory to P(R), the exact category of finite projective left R-modules, and write K(R), K_n(R). For a unital f:R→S, the map is induced by f_!. Prove functoriality using the coherent tensor isomorphisms. Its degree-zero comparison carries a projective class to the same exact K₀ class. Prove finite-product compatibility and filtered continuity in every connective degree: the finite idempotent-matrix model descends objects, maps and their finitely many equations to a common stage, even when transition maps are not injective. The dual P↦Hom_R(P,R) gives an exact equivalence P(R)^op≃P(R^op), and opposite-ring K-group isomorphisms natural in ring maps.

Rings in Type u use u-small projective models. Products are finite, filtered diagrams small. Duality takes values in right modules; the dual-basis comparison commutes with scalar extension. Flatness, noetherianness and invariant basis number are unnecessary.

(Weibel IV, D 6.3.2 and Elementary properties 6.4, pp.IV.55–IV.56;Elementary Properties 6.4, the ring instances, pp.IV.55–56.)

Use:

- `KSpace.ofRing`: ΩBQ(P(R)) in the ring universe.
- `KSpace.ofRing_map`: The based map induced by projBaseChange.
- `KSpace.ofRing_map_id`: Identity compatibility through model comparison.
- `KSpace.ofRing_map_comp`: Composition compatibility up to natural homotopy.
- `KGroup.ofRing_zero_equiv`: π₀K(R)≃RingK0 R≃ExactK0(P(R)), preserving [P], naturally in R.
- `KGroup.ofRing_prod`: Finite-product comparison.
- `KGroup.ofRing_colimit`: Filtered-colimit comparison by idempotent descent.
- `KGroup.ofRing_op`: The duality isomorphism K_n(Rᵒᵖ)≃K_n(R).

**Checks.**

- The two projections R × S → R,S give the product isomorphism in degree zero and every higher degree.
- Identity and two composable ring maps give the same K-map as the tensor unit/associativity isomorphisms.
- ℤ → ℤ/2 induces exact scalar extension on the split projective category although it is not flat on all modules.
- An idempotent matrix over a filtered colimit and an equality between two maps descend at a sufficiently large stage.
- The degree-zero group of K(R) is RingK0 R, and K₀(f) is RingK0.map f; for R = ℤ it is ℤ generated by [ℤ].
- For a commutative ring the isomorphism K₀(R^op) ≅ K₀(R) induced by duality, composed with R^op = R, sends [P] to [Hom_R(P, R)]; for a Dedekind domain it inverts the ideal class of an invertible ideal, so it is not the identity when the class group has an element of order greater than two.

*Needs:* §3.1; §2.5; §2.6; §2.4; §2.3; the K₀ contract; `finiteProjectiveModules`; `finiteProjectiveModulesExactStructure`; `finiteProjectiveModulesExactStructure_eq_split`; `ExactK0.hom_ext`; §2.3–2.6 and §3.1; finite-projective K₀ contract.

### 3.3 Stable matrices and elementary transformations

Starting from the finite general linear groups, form GL(R)=colim_n GL_n(R) under g↦diag(g,1). Define e_ij(a)=1+aE_ij for i≠j and E(R) as the subgroup generated by their stabilized images. Construct block sum and ring-map functoriality. Prove e_ij(a)e_ij(b)=e_ij(a+b), e_ij(a)⁻¹=e_ij(−a), and [e_ij(a),e_jk(b)]=e_ik(ab) for pairwise distinct indices. Define the classical additive K₁ as Additive(GL(R)/E(R)), after the normality theorem below.

(Weibel III, D 1.1–1.2, equation (1.3.1), pp.III.1–4.)

Use:

- `StableGL`: diagonal-stabilized group colimit.
- `stableElementary`: subgroup generated by stable elementary matrices.
- `StableGL.blockSum`: Block sum and its compatibility with stabilization.
- `StableGL.map`: group map of a unital ring homomorphism.
- `classicalK1`: quotient abelian group after Whitehead normality.

**Checks.**

- Stabilizing the 1×1 matrix (u) gives diag(u,1), so the identity unit gives the identity stable matrix.
- e₁₂(a)e₁₂(−a)=1; using +a for the inverse fails over ℤ at a=1.
- Over 𝔽₂, GL₂ has order 6 and its elementary subgroup is not perfect; the third distinct index is necessary for the commutator proof.

*Needs:* Mathlib Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup and finite matrix algebra; group colimits and subgroup closure.

### 3.4 Whitehead’s stable commutator theorem

Prove E(R) is perfect and equals [GL(R),GL(R)]. The elementary commutator identity supplies perfection after adjoining a third index. For the reverse inclusion, express a stabilized commutator as a product of elementary block matrices using diag(g,g⁻¹)∈E(R). E(R) is normal, GL/E is abelian, and any homomorphism from GL into an abelian group factors uniquely through it. These are the precise subgroup inputs for the plus construction.

(Weibel III, L 1.3.2, Whitehead L 1.3.3 and equation (1.3.4), p.III.4.)

Use:

- `stableElementary_perfect`: E(R) equals its own commutator subgroup.
- `stableElementary_eq_commutator`: E(R) is the stable GL commutator subgroup.
- `classicalK1.unit`: Unit classes by GL₁ stabilization.

**Checks.**

- For a field, GL/E is the multiplicative group of units under determinant.
- Over ℤ, the class of −1 has order 2; it is not annihilated by quotienting to zero.
- At finite rank 2 over 𝔽₂, E₂≅S₃ is not perfect. Stabilization is essential.

*Needs:* §3.3; group commutators.

### 3.5 Idempotent extension for nonunital maps

For an additive multiplicative map h:A→B between unital rings, put e=h(1), prove e²=e and h(a)e=eh(a)=h(a), and define the exact right-projective functor P↦P⊗_A eB. The module eB is the image of the idempotent left-multiplication map on B, hence finite projective, and tensoring a finite-projective A-summand preserves that property. Construct block tensor comparison under ℤ⋉A≅ℤ×A and ℤ⋉B≅ℤ×B; Layer 8 uses it to identify the connective fibre map. This supplies nonunital corner maps before the Bass axioms. For the zero map e=0 the functor is zero, while for a unital map e=1 it is ordinary scalar extension.

(Weibel, §II.2.7.2, p.76;§IV.6.3.5–6.4, p.321;elementary bimodule calculation above.)

Use:

- `idempotentBaseChange`: exact finite-projective functor using eB.
- `idempotentBaseChange_unital`: For h(1)=1 it agrees with scalar extension.
- `idempotentBaseChange_comp`: tensor comparison for composable nonunital maps.
- `idempotentBaseChange_unitization`: block decomposition identifies the associated fibre map.

**Checks.**

- For the zero map A→B, eB=0 and every projective maps to zero.
- For id_A, eA=A and the tensor unit recovers P.
- For the corner R→M₂R, e=diag(1,0), and eM₂R is the first-row projective; the image of R is not the whole M₂R.

*Needs:* §3.1–3.2; Mathlib idempotent image and split projective modules.

### 3.6 The Q-extension category

Define the Q-extension category ExtQ(A): objects are conflations A₀↣B↠C. A morphism from A₀↣B↠C to A₀′↣B′↠C′ is represented by an intermediate conflation A₀′↣B↠M, an inflation α:A₀′↣A₀, an inflation β:B↣B′, a deflation ρ:M↠C and an inflation ι:M↣C′. Require the three-row diagram to commute: the intermediate kernel map is α followed by A₀↣B, the source quotient is B↠M followed by ρ, β carries the intermediate kernel to the target kernel, and the target quotient composed with β is B↠M followed by ι. Identify representatives under an isomorphism of M preserving every map. The right column is the Q-span C↞M↣C′, giving t:ExtQ(A)→QA. Its fibre E_C is a groupoid: α and β are then isomorphisms over C. Identify E_0 with Core(A), by A₀↦(A₀=A₀↠0). Direct sum on the kernel and middle terms defines its Core(A)-action. This is a Q-type category of extensions, different from the ordinary category of maps of conflations.

A is small exact; only the later fibre comparison needs split exactness. Morphisms use admissible quotient/pullback data.

(Weibel IV, D 7.3;(7.3.1), p.IV.62;§7, opening, p.IV.61.)

Use:

- `ExtCat`: extension category of an exact category.
- `ExtCat.quot`: The quotient projection to QA.
- `ExtCat.fibre_zero`: The zero fibre is Core(A).

**Checks.**

- The fibre over the zero object is the groupoid of isomorphisms.
- The right column of every morphism (7.3.1) is a morphism of Q(A), and composing morphisms of EA composes these columns, so taking the quotient term is a functor t from EA to Q(A).
- The fibration criterion does not apply to the extension category over Q(A) itself unless the category is zero; the localised functor must be used.
- EA is not the category of conflations: its morphisms over an identity of Q(A) are pairs of isomorphisms (Weibel 7.4), whereas a conflation X ↣ X ↠ 0 with X nonzero has the zero endomorphism in the category of conflations; a formalisation that reused the category of conflations here would lose the identification of the fibre over 0 with the groupoid of isomorphisms.

*Needs:* §2.1; `CategoryTheory.Core`.

### 3.7 Monoidal products in the extension fibres

On E_C, define the product of A₁↣B₁↠C and A₂↣B₂↠C by A₁⊕A₂↣B₁×_C B₂↠C. The trivial extension 0↣C=C is its unit. Construct symmetric monoidal coherence from pullback universality. The split-extension functor η_C:S→E_C, A↦(A↣A⊕C↠C), is faithful and strong symmetric monoidal. If A is split exact, every E_C-object is isomorphic to a split extension, so the associated translation-action category is connected.

For C∈A, Only the last assertion uses split exactness.

(Weibel IV, L 7.5 and Remark 7.5.2, pp.IV.62–63.)

Use:

- `ExtFibre.tensor`: displayed pullback product in E_C.
- `ExtFibre.unit`: sequence 0 ↣ C = C.
- `ExtFibre.split`: faithful symmetric monoidal split-extension functor η_C.
- `ExtFibre.splitEssentiallySurjective`: For split exact A, every E_C-object is isomorphic to η_C(A₀).

**Checks.**

- At C=0 the product identifies with direct sum.
- η_C(A₁)*η_C(A₂) ≅ η_C(A₁⊕A₂), compatibly with quotient C.
- A nonsplit extension is not isomorphic to η_C of its kernel.

*Needs:* §3.6; `ExactStructure.conflation_baseChange`; `ExactStructure.conflation_biprod`.

### 3.8 Cartesian extension lifts

For the Q-span C′↞M↣C and an extension A↣B↠C, form B′=B×_C M and let A′ be the kernel of B′↠M↠C′. The extension is the cartesian lift over that Q-arrow. Construct pullback functors E_C→E_C′ and their coherent identity and composition isomorphisms. The S-action commutes with these lifts, so localizing the fibres preserves the prefibred structure.

Choose span and pullback data; comparisons are natural isomorphisms, with A→A′ and B′→B oriented as in §3.6.

(Weibel IV, L 7.7, E 7.2 and E 7.5, pp.IV.63–65.)

Use:

- `ExtCat.baseChange`: fibre functor φ* defined by pullback and composite kernel.
- `ExtCat.cartesianArrow`: canonical cartesian arrow φ*E→E over φ.
- `ExtCat.baseChange_comp`: Coherent (ψφ)*≅φ*ψ* with compatible domains.
- `ExtCat.baseChange_zero_inflation`: Base change along 0↣C extracts the kernel.
- `ExtCat.baseChange_zero_deflation`: Base change along 0↞C extracts the middle term.

**Checks.**

- Lifting id_C gives a sequence canonically isomorphic to E.
- An arrow E→φ*E would project from C to C′ and cannot lie over φ when C′ and C differ.
- For a split extension A↣A⊕C↠C the two zero lifts yield A and A⊕C respectively.

*Needs:* §3.6; `ExactStructure.conflation_baseChange`; `ExactStructure.conflation_comp_of_isPullback`; Layer 1.

### 3.9 Contractibility of the localised extension-action category

For split exact A, prove B(S⁻¹S)→B(S⁻¹E_C) is a homotopy equivalence. In the action-localization fibration, the third term is the realization of the translation-action category. Its product is connected and homotopy associative; the diagonal supplies id≃2·id. The H-space inverse then cancels one copy and contracts this third term. Track the map as the one induced by η_C.

Core(A) acts faithfully on E_C. The action fibration and CW realization of §1.6 apply; H-space cancellation needs connectedness.

(Weibel IV, P 7.6, p.IV.63.)

*Needs:* §3.7; Layer 1.

### 3.10 The localised extension category fibres over Q

Prove that every base change between the localized extension fibres is a homotopy equivalence: compare the lift along each inflation and reversed deflation with the split-extension functor. Theorem B then gives B(S⁻¹S)→B(S⁻¹ExtQ(A))→BQA as a homotopy-fibre sequence over zero.

A is split exact; cartesian lifts respect the faithful action, with coherent comparison isomorphisms.

(Weibel IV, T 7.8;proof, pp.IV.63–64.)

*Needs:* §3.8; §3.9; §2.1; Layer 1.

### 3.11 Contractibility of extensions

Contract BExtQ(A) for any small exact A by the extension diagrams and the inflation subcategory of QA. For split exact A, prove that localization by its S-action leaves the total category contractible. The fibre sequence of §3.10 identifies B(S⁻¹S) with ΩBQA. The localization invariance concerns this action on this contractible model, not arbitrary localization of categories.

The inflation category has zero as initial object. Use subdivision and the action-localization comparison of §1.3 and §1.6.

(Weibel IV, Proof of T 7.1 and E 7.3, pp.IV.64–65.)

*Needs:* §3.6; Layer 1.

### 3.12 The plus-equals-Q theorem

For a small split exact category A, prove ΩBQA≃B(S⁻¹S), where S=Core(A) with direct sum. Localize the Q-extension fibres by the S-action, prove the base-change equivalences, and use Theorem B together with contractibility of the localized total category. For P(R), identify the zero component with BGL(R)⁺ and obtain the plus/Q comparison in every positive degree. After choices of component translations this gives K(R)≃K₀(R)_discrete×BGL(R)⁺ as spaces.

The action is faithful and A split exact. Ring maps and block sum preserve the zero-component comparison; §3.15 controls other component translations.

(Weibel IV, T 7.1 and C 7.2, pp.IV.61–IV.62.)

*Needs:* §3.6; §2.5; Layer 1; §3.10; §3.11.

### 3.13 Projective complements and cofinality

Apply the monoidal cofinality theorem to finite free modules inside finite projectives. A finite projective P admits a finite-projective complement P′ with P⊕P′ finite free, so the inclusion induces isomorphisms on all positive K-groups and an injection on K₀. This explains why stable GL detects the positive groups while its free-module components need not account for all of K₀. Use §1.6, rather than the later Waldhausen cofinality theorem, in the plus comparison.

The subgroupoid on finite free modules is full, and finite extensions split. No invariant-basis-number assumption is needed.

(Weibel IV, Cofinality T 4.11;its proof, and the paragraph before C 4.11.1, pp.IV.44–45.)

*Needs:* `Module.Finite.exists_comp_eq_id_of_projective`; `LinearMap.ker_eq_range_of_comp_eq_id`; §3.12; Layer 1.

### 3.14 Early absolute K0/K1 comparison for rings

Prove natural comparison π₀K(R)≃ExactK₀(P(R)) and the zero-component comparison π₁K(R)≃GL(R)/E(R). The latter sends a stabilized projective automorphism to its loop under the group-completion and plus/Q comparisons. Check block-sum compatibility and functoriality for scalar extension. This supplies the low-degree adapter needed by relative triples and Laurent-unit multiplication; it makes no Bloch-group assertion.

GL is the stable colimit under diagonal stabilization, E the stable elementary subgroup. The comparisons use the split exact structure on P(R).

(Weibel IV, D 1.1–1.1.2, pp.IV.2–3;T 7.1, C 7.2 and E 7.9, pp.IV.61–65.)

*Needs:* §2.4; §3.12; §3.13; the K₀ contract; Layer 1.

### 3.15 What the product description does not say

The comparison K(R) ≃ K₀(R)_discrete × BGL(R)⁺ is an equivalence of spaces after choosing a point in every component. These points represent virtual classes [P] − [Q]; they cannot in general be chosen as projective modules. Translations identify each component with the component of zero, but are not naturally chosen in R. Keep the canonical plus comparison with the zero component separate from this product description. No splitting of the connective spectrum into its degree-zero and positive parts follows.

R is unital, with no invariant-basis-number hypothesis. The group K₀ has the discrete topology. The infinite-loop structure is the one constructed from the S-deloopings.

(Weibel IV, C 7.2, p.IV.62.)

**Checks.**

- Over a field, −1 ∈ K₀(k)=ℤ is not represented by a vector space; it is [0]−[k].
- For k×k, the components are indexed by ℤ², not by a single rank.
- The comparison on the zero component is compatible with ring maps even though arbitrary chosen translations of other components are not.

*Needs:* §3.2; §3.12.

### Examples

The unital map k→M₂(k) sends the rank-one free module to the whole matrix ring, of Morita rank 2. The nonunital corner instead gives the rank-one row projective. Over k×k the K₀ group is ℤ² and the free-subcategory image is its diagonal.

## Layer 4: Exact additivity, resolution and abelian localization

### 4.1 The 3×3 lemma for exact categories

Establish intrinsic 3×3 lemma for E-conflations. In a commutative three-row, three-column diagram with conflation columns, a conflation middle row and either outer row force the other outer row to be a conflation. If both outer rows are conflations, the middle row is a conflation provided its two maps compose to zero. Prove these statements through admissible pullback–pushout squares and kernel–cokernel universality, without an ambient abelian category.

Use the exact axioms and their duals. The second implication requires zero composite in addition to diagram commutativity.

(Bühler, C 3.6 (3 × 3-L );its proof, pp.13–14 (arXiv v2);P 3.1 and L 3.5, pp.12–13 (arXiv v2).)

*Needs:* `ExactStructure`; `ExactStructure.conflation_cobaseChange`; `ExactStructure.conflation_baseChange`; `ExactStructure.bicartesianSq_of_isPushout_of_isInflation`; `ExactStructure.exists_conflation_comp`; `ExactStructure.conflation_comp_of_isPullback`.

### 4.2 The exact category of conflations

Equip the ConflationCategory(E) with the componentwise exact structure: a sequence of its objects is a conflation when each of its three sequences of components is an E-conflation. Prove exact axioms by §4.1. Show that the three evaluation functors s,t,q are exact and that (X,Z)↦(X↣X⊕Z↠Z) is exact. Exact functors into this category correspond to pointwise conflations of exact functors into A. This new exact structure extends the existing underlying category and evaluation functors; it is different from ExtQ of §3.6.

A is essentially small exact; rows are witnessed conflations and component sequences are maps of short complexes.

(Weibel V, Universal Example 1.1.1, p.V.1;Bühler, E 3.9 (Heller) and Remark 3.10, p.16 (arXiv v2);Weibel II, Extension Categories 9.3 and P 9.3.1, pp.II.92–93.)

Use:

- `ConflationCategory.exactStructure`: Componentwise exactness on the supplied conflation category.
- `ConflationCategory.conflation_iff`: Conflations are exactly the three-column E-conflations.
- `ConflationCategory.isConflationExact_sub`: Exactness of subterm evaluation s.
- `ConflationCategory.isConflationExact_total`: Exactness of total-term evaluation t.
- `ConflationCategory.isConflationExact_quot`: Exactness of quotient evaluation q.
- `ConflationCategory.coprod`: The split-sequence functor (X,Z)↦(X↣X⊕Z↠Z).
- `ConflationCategory.sub_quot_coprod`: (s, q) ∘ ∐ = id and t ∘ ∐ ≅ ⊞.
- `ConflationCategory.exactFunctorEquiv`: Exact functors into E(A) correspond to conflations of exact functors.
- `ConflationCategory.essentiallySmall`: Essential smallness inherited from A.

**Checks.**

- A sequence of conflations is a conflation of E(A) if and only if its three columns are E-conflations; a sequence that is a kernel–cokernel pair of short complexes but has a column that is not an E-conflation is not one.
- (s, q) ∘ ∐ is the identity of A × A, and t ∘ ∐ is naturally isomorphic to the biproduct functor.
- (s, q) induces ExactK0 (E(A)) ≃ ExactK0 A × ExactK0 A, with inverse induced by ∐ (Weibel, Proposition II.9.3.1).
- For the category of abelian groups with its canonical exact structure, E(Ab) is not an abelian category (Bühler, Remark 3.10), so its exact structure is not the canonical structure of an abelian category.

*Needs:* `ExactStructure`; `ExactStructure.ConflationCategory`; `ExactStructure.conflation_cobaseChange`; `ExactStructure.conflation_baseChange`; `ExactStructure.conflation_biprod`; §4.1.

### 4.3 The Additivity theorem

For the componentwise exact category of conflations, prove that (s,q):QConf(A)→QA×QA realizes to a homotopy equivalence. Therefore a pointwise conflation F′↣F↠F″ of exact functors satisfies K(F)≃K(F′)+K(F″), with the homotopy compatible with the H-space structures. Iterate to a finite admissible filtration with exact quotient functors. For a bounded admissibly exact sequence of exact functors, the alternating sum of induced maps vanishes.

Categories are essentially small. Every functor, including each filtration quotient, is exact.

(Weibel V, Additivity T 1.2;its proof, p.V.2;Extension T 1.3 and its proof for exact categories, pp.V.2–4;C 1.2.1 and P 1.8, pp.V.2 and V.9.)

*Needs:* §2.5; §4.2; Layer 1; `ExactStructure.conflation_cobaseChange`; `ExactStructure.conflation_baseChange`.

### 4.4 Length-one resolution comparison

Let P be a replete full exact subcategory of H, closed under extensions and under kernels of admissible epimorphisms between its objects. Assume that every X ∈ H admits a conflation P₁ ↣ P₀ ↠ X with P₀,P₁ ∈ P. Prove that QP → QH induces a homotopy equivalence. Use the full subcategory of QH on P-objects only as an intermediate comma model: it need not have the same morphisms as QP. Contract the comma categories by comparing length-one resolutions and their common refinements.

Use induced exact structures and essentially small categories; length ≤1 resolution is stronger than a P-cover.

(Quillen, §4 T 3 full proof, pp.108–109.)

**Checks.**

- For P=H every object has the resolution 0 ↣ X = X, and the comparison is the identity.
- For a DVR, a finite torsion module has a length-one resolution by finite free modules; the theorem applies.
- Over k[ε]/(ε²), the simple module k has projective covers but no finite projective resolution. Covers alone would incorrectly force its Cartan map, multiplication by 2, to be an isomorphism.

*Needs:* §2.1; Layer 1.

### 4.5 Resolution dimensions and successive exact subcategories

For a resolving P ⊂ H, let H_n be the full subcategory of objects with admissible P-resolution length at most n. Prove extension closure and the admissible-kernel closure needed for H_n ⊂ H_{n+1}; every object of H_{n+1} has a length-one H_n-resolution. Apply the preceding comparison successively. If every H-object has finite P-resolution, the filtered union of the H_n is H and finite-data continuity gives K(P) ≃ K(H).

P is replete, full, extension closed and closed under admissible kernels between P-objects. Resolutions are finite and admissible.

(Quillen, §4 C 1 and its three-inequality proof, pp.109–111.)

*Needs:* §4.4; §2.6.

### 4.6 The Resolution theorem

For a resolving full exact P⊂H, assume every H-object has a finite admissible P-resolution. The inclusion then induces K(P)≃K(H), and hence isomorphisms in all connective degrees. Prove this using the bounded-resolution subcategories and §4.4–4.5. For a ring, compare its finite projectives with the finitely generated modules admitting finite projective resolutions; in the finite-global-dimension noetherian scope this identifies K-theory with G-theory. The new assertion is the higher-space comparison; the degree-zero resolution comparison is a supplier.

P⊂H is replete, full, extension closed and admissible-kernel closed. H is essentially small and every H-object has finite admissible P-resolution. For rings use finite projectives and modules finitely resolved by them; left noetherian finite-left-global-dimension rings suffice. Scheme resolution is separate.

(Weibel V, Resolution T 3.1;proof, p.V.20;Weibel II, Example 8.2.4, p.II.77;E 9.10(d), p.II.100.)

*Needs:* §2.5; §2.6; Layer 1; `ExactStructure.resolutionEquiv`; `moduleResolutionEquiv`; §4.5.

### 4.7 The actual two intersection functors in dévissage

In the dévissage comma model, an object is an admissible layer L⊂M⊂X with M/L in B. Given one fixed layer L₀⊂M₀, intersections with L₀ and M₀ provide functorial comparisons of layer posets. Show that the resulting finite zigzag contracts the comma category when X has a finite B-filtration. Intersections and quotient stability are essential: the filtration is used to reduce to one B-layer, not to manufacture exact successive-quotient functors.

B is a full exact abelian subcategory, stable under subobjects and quotients in A. Objects of A have finite B-filtrations.

(Quillen, §5 T 4 full proof, pp.112–113.)

*Needs:* §2.1; Layer 1.

### 4.8 The Devissage theorem

Let B⊂A be a full exact abelian subcategory stable under subobjects and quotients, and assume every A-object has a finite filtration with quotients in B. Prove K(B)≃K(A) by the contracted layer comma categories and Theorem A. For a nilpotent ideal I in a noetherian ring, the filtration by powers of I identifies G(R/I) with G(R). For the category of modules killed by a power of a central element, use its filtered union of finite-exponent subcategories and the same argument.

A,B are essentially small; B need not be extension closed. Successive quotients need not give exact functors, so use dévissage rather than functor-filtration additivity.

(Weibel V, Devissage T 4.1;proof, p.V.33;Open Problem 4.1.1, p.V.33.)

*Needs:* §2.5; Layer 1; `simpleClassBasis`; §4.7.

### 4.9 Isomorphic quotient comma models

Let B be a Serre subcategory of a small abelian A, let q:A→A/B be the exact quotient, and fix L∈A/B. Inside L↓Qq retain those (X,u) for which u:L→qX is an isomorphism. Prove its inclusion is a realization equivalence by contracting the refinement comma categories using representatives of quotient subobjects. At L=0 this model identifies with QB: qX=0 means X∈B, and the induced Q-morphisms are precisely those of B.

Use the abelian Serre quotient and fractions whose kernels and cokernels lie in B.

(Weibel V, Claims5.1.2–5.1.3, p.V.36;Quillen, §5 T 5 and L 1–5, pp.113–116.)

*Needs:* §2.1; §2.2; Layer 1; `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.IsSerreClass`.

### 4.10 Models of a quotient object with kernel functor

For N∈A, construct E_N on maps h:X→N becoming isomorphisms under q. Its arrows are Q-spans between X-terms, compatible with the maps to N. The kernels belong to B and the induced kernel spans define k_N:E_N→QB. Let E′_N be the full subcategory on epimorphic h. A map g:N→N′ inverted by q induces g_* by postcomposition, and the kernel comparison is natural up to the Q-transformation.

A is small abelian, B Serre, and exact structures abelian. Both ker(h) and coker(h) lie in B.

(Weibel V, D before Claim5.1.4 and Claim5.1.6, pp.V.36–37;Quillen, §5 T 5 and L 1–5, pp.113–116.)

Use:

- `LocalizationModel`: category E_N of quotient-isomorphism lifts h:A→N and Q-spans over N.
- `LocalizationModel.kernel`: kernel functor k_N to QB.
- `LocalizationModel.epimorphic`: full subcategory E′_N.
- `LocalizationModel.postcompose`: functor g_* for g invertible modulo B.
- `LocalizationModel.postcompose_id`: Postcomposition by identity is identity.
- `LocalizationModel.postcompose_comp`: Postcomposition by g′g is the composite.
- `LocalizationModel.kernel_postcompose`: Natural inflation ker(h)→ker(gh).

**Checks.**

- For h=id_N, its kernel is zero.
- In finite 2-primary groups, h:ℤ/4→ℤ/2 has kernel ℤ/2 and cokernel zero; killing that Serre category makes qh invertible.
- For h=id_{ℤ/4} and g:ℤ/4→ℤ/2, the kernel comparison is 0→ℤ/2, with cokernel in the Serre subcategory.

*Needs:* §2.1; §2.2; `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.IsSerreClass`.

### 4.11 Epimorphic kernel equivalence

Prove Bk′_N:B(E′_N)→BQB is an equivalence. Factor a Q-arrow in the two possible orders available in an abelian category; push out its kernel inflation to obtain compatible epimorphic models. Apply Theorem A to the resulting comma categories, contracting them through their common pushout refinements.

Use E′_N from §4.10 and the admissible Q-span composition, not ordinary maps of kernels alone.

(Weibel V, Claim5.1.4, p.V.36;Quillen, §5 T 5 and L 1–5, pp.113–116.)

*Needs:* §4.10; §2.1; Layer 1.

### 4.12 Epimorphic models suffice

For N_i⊂N with N/N_i∈B, pull the epimorphic model over N_i into E_N. Their union compares E′_N with E_N by common image refinements. Prove B(E′_N)→B(E_N) and Bk_N are equivalences. If qg is invertible, the comparison for g_* commutes with the kernel equivalences and is also an equivalence.

The subobject indexing category includes N and is directed under sums. B is closed under subobjects, quotients and extensions.

(Weibel V, Claims5.1.5–5.1.6, pp.V.36–37;Quillen, §5 T 5 and L 1–5, pp.113–116.)

*Needs:* §4.10; §4.11; Layer 1.

### 4.13 Filtered quotient models

For L∈A/B, organize representatives (N,qN≅L) and their maps over L into the quotient refinement category. Prove it is filtered by clearing the finitely many denominators of each finite diagram and equality. The isomorphic comma model is the filtered union of the E_N models; finite-data realization continuity makes each comparison a weak equivalence. Identify the base-change map for 0↣L with these comparisons and conclude the homotopy-fibre criterion for Qq.

Refinements preserve qN≅L; use quotient fractions and §1.1, §4.9–4.12.

(Weibel V, Claim5.1.7 and conclusion of T 5.1, p.V.37;Quillen, §5 T 5 and L 1–5, pp.113–116.)

*Needs:* §4.9; §4.12; §2.1; Layer 1.

### 4.14 Serre localization

For a Serre subcategory B of a small abelian A, prove K(B)→K(A)→K(A/B) is a homotopy-fibre sequence. Construct nullhomotopy from the quotient functor, and identify the fibre by the localization models of §4.9–4.13. Obtain the natural exact sequence K₁(A/B)→K₀(B)→K₀(A)→K₀(A/B)→0 and its higher terms. Exact functors of Serre pairs preserve the boundary. An arbitrary exact subcategory does not satisfy this theorem’s hypotheses.

B is full, subobject-, quotient- and extension-closed. The quotient is abelian Serre, distinct from the additive ideal quotient.

(Weibel V, Abelian Localization T 5.1;(5.1.1), p.V.35;E 5.1, pp.V.37–38.)

*Needs:* §4.8; §4.6; §2.2; Layer 1; `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.IsSerreClass`; §4.13; §4.9.

### 4.15 Relative triples for an additive functor

For a small additive T:C→D, define the relative split group by triples (P,α,Q) with α:T(P)≅T(Q). Take the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of triples and impose direct-sum additivity and [P,α,Q]+[Q,β,R]=[P,β∘α,R]. Its difference map is [P]−[Q] in split K₀(C). The groups here use split additive categories; comparison with nonsplit exact K₁ is a separate theorem.

T is additive and C,D small. Completion versions apply the construction explicitly to C^♮,D^♮.

(Weibel, §II.2.10, p.77;E II.2.17(a–b), p.81.)

Use:

- `RelativeAdditiveTriple`: Objects P,Q of C and an isomorphism TP≅TQ.
- `ClassicalRelativeK0`: abelian group presented by triple sum and composition relations.
- `ClassicalRelativeK0.difference`: map to split K0(C),[(P,α,Q)]↦[P]−[Q].
- `ClassicalRelativeK0.map`: Maps from additive commuting squares with a specified comparison isomorphism.

**Checks.**

- [P,id,P]=0 follows from the composition relation.
- [P,α,Q]=−[Q,α⁻¹,P], so the difference map changes sign under inversion.
- For C=finite-dimensional k-spaces and D=0, the group is ℤ and [k,unique,0] maps to +1; for T=id the relative group is zero.

*Needs:* the layer prerequisites.

### 4.16 Stable automorphism boundary

Define `ClassicalAdditiveK1 C` for small additive C by the abelian presentation with generators (X,α), α∈Aut(X), modulo composition, direct-sum and isomorphism-conjugacy relations. An additive functor induces a map. Identify this group with K₁ of C equipped with the split exact structure, and with GL(R)/E(R) for C=P(R). If every D-object is a direct summand of some T(P), define δ:K₁^cl(D)→K₀^cl(T). For α∈Aut(X), choose X⊕Y≅T(P), extend α by id_Y, and take [P,α⊕id_Y,P]. Prove independence of complements and transport, preservation of composition and direct sum, and naturality in cofinal squares of additive functors.

Density means summand density. Use the split groups of §4.15 with consistent completions.

(Weibel, §II.2.10.2, p.77;E II.2.17(c), p.81;Weibel III, L 1.6, C 1.6.3 and L 1.7, pp.III.7–8;Weibel IV, T 4.10.1 and Example 4.11.1, pp.IV.43–44.)

Use:

- `ClassicalAdditiveK1`: automorphism presentation of split-exact K₁.
- `ClassicalAdditiveK1.class`: class of an object automorphism.
- `ClassicalAdditiveK1.composition`: [αβ]=[α]+[β].
- `ClassicalAdditiveK1.directSum`: [α⊕β]=[α]+[β].
- `ClassicalAdditiveK1.map`: additive-functor map.
- `ClassicalAdditiveK1.quillenEquiv`: Comparison with K₁ for the split exact structure.
- `ClassicalAdditiveK1.boundary`: stable relative-triple boundary under the cofinality hypothesis.

**Checks.**

- The identity automorphism has class 0; an inverse automorphism has class −[α].
- For finite-dimensional k-spaces, the presentation maps isomorphically to k× by determinant; diag(u,v) has class uv.
- The zero additive category has zero group. Over ℤ, the automorphism −1 of ℤ has nonzero class of order 2.
- For T=id, the relative triple (P,α,P) has zero relative class, so the boundary is zero.

*Needs:* §4.15.

### 4.17 The classical five-term sequence of an additive functor

For additive T dense up to summands, prove K₁^cl(C)→K₁^cl(D)→K₀^cl(T)→K₀^split(C)→K₀^split(D) is exact at the three interior groups. The middle maps are δ and the triple difference. Establish naturality and complement stability by the triple relations; there is no surjectivity assertion onto the last group.

C,D are small additive and every D-object is a summand of T(P). Karoubi applications use completion-corrected split K₀.

(Weibel, §II.2.10 and E II.2.17(d–e), pp.77, 81;Karoubi 1970, T 2.1, PDF p.27.)

*Needs:* §4.16.

### Examples

A DVR torsion module has a length-one free resolution. The simple module over k[ε]/ε² has covers but no finite projective resolution; its Cartan map is multiplication by 2. Finite-length dévissage records composition factors, not only projective ranks.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–3, exact square calculus, the supplied Serre quotient and degree-zero Euler comparisons.

## Layer 5: Waldhausen filtrations and deloopings

### 5.1 Waldhausen structures and extra axioms

Define a category with cofibrations by a zero object, a wide subcategory of cofibrations containing isomorphisms and zero-source maps, and stability under pushouts along cofibrations. A Waldhausen structure adds a wide subcategory w of weak equivalences containing isomorphisms and satisfying gluing for maps of cofibration pushout squares. Define exact functors by preservation of zero, cofibrations, weak equivalences and these pushouts. Keep saturation (two out of three), extension for cofibration sequences, and a cylinder functor with its cylinder axiom as separate hypotheses. Define Waldhausen K₀ by generators [X], weak-equivalence relations and [B]=[A]+[B/A] for cofibrations A↣B.

C is pointed and small. Cylinders include endpoint cofibrations, weak projections and their pushout cofibration conditions.

(Weibel II, D 9.1;(W0)–(W2), p.II.87;D 9.1.1 and D 9.1.2, pp.II.87–II.88;Weibel IV, Extension axiom 8.2.1, p.IV.67.)

Use:

- `CategoryWithCofibrations`: three cofibration axioms.
- `WaldhausenCategory`: Cofibrations together with weak equivalences and the gluing axiom.
- `WaldhausenCategory.IsSaturated`: Two out of three.
- `WaldhausenCategory.HasExtensionAxiom`: Extension for weak maps of cofibration sequences.
- `WaldhausenCategory.CylinderFunctor`: cylinder functor and its axiom.
- `WaldhausenCategory.K0`: Grothendieck group.
- `WaldhausenCategory.ofExact`: An exact category as a Waldhausen category.
- `WaldhausenCategory.exactFunctor`: Exact functors between Waldhausen categories.

**Checks.**

- Finite-dimensional vector spaces with injections and isomorphisms have K₀=ℤ, with [k²]=2[k].
- For bounded finite-dimensional complexes with quasi-isomorphisms, the two-term identity complex has class zero, while k concentrated in degree zero has class 1.
- If every morphism of a pointed category is a weak equivalence, [X]=[0]=0 for every X; using only isomorphism relations would fail this test.
- Split projective modules give the exact-category K₀ comparison; an arbitrary epimorphism is not a cofibration in that model.

*Needs:* `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPushouts`; `ExactStructure`.

### 5.2 S-diagrams and latching cofibrations

Define S_nC using diagrams A_{ij}, 0≤i≤j≤n, with A_{ii}=0 and a chosen cofibration sequence A_{ij}↣A_{ik}↠A_{jk} for each i≤j≤k. The quotient squares commute and are pushouts. Diagram natural transformations are the morphisms. Define its cofibrations by the relative latching maps, not merely by cofibrations of all A_{ij}; weak equivalences are objectwise. Restrictions along monotone maps give exact face and degeneracy functors and satisfy the simplicial identities. Identify S₀C with the zero category, S₁C with C, and S₂C with its category of cofibration sequences. The three faces of S₂ are quotient, total and subobject, in that order.

C is small with cofibrations; add its Waldhausen structure when taking wS_nC. Compatible quotient choices are part of each diagram.

(Weibel IV, D 8.3;(8.3.0), p.IV.67;D 8.3.1, p.IV.67;§8.3, low terms, p.IV.67.)

Use:

- `SConstruction`: n-th term of the S-construction.
- `SConstruction.cofibration`: latching condition defining its cofibrations.
- `SConstruction.face`: face functors.
- `SConstruction.degeneracy`: degeneracy functors.
- `SConstruction.simplicial`: simplicial identities.
- `SConstruction.two_eq_ext`: second term is the extension category.

**Checks.**

- For 0↣k↣k², the S₂ faces are k,k²,k, so their K₀ ranks are 1,2,1.
- The degeneracy of k gives a repeated filtration with one zero quotient; the face–degeneracy identities recover k.
- In S₂ of vector spaces, the map (0↣k↠k)→(k↣k↠0) with total map id is objectwise injective on sub and total terms, but its quotient map k→0 is not injective; checking only the filtration terms misses the required latching condition.
- S₀ has only zero data, whereas S₁ contains k and its automorphisms.

*Needs:* §5.1; `ExactStructure.ConflationCategory`.

### 5.3 Isomorphic functors on object S

An exact natural isomorphism between functors of categories with cofibrations induces a simplicial homotopy on δC=Ob(S_•C), not only a homotopy of ordinary nerves. Prove that δC→nerve(iS_•C) induces a homotopy equivalence on realization by the resulting contraction of the isomorphism direction.

The natural-transformation components are invertible and all functors preserve cofibration pushouts.

(Waldhausen, L 1.4.1 and its corollary, pp.335–336.)

*Needs:* §5.2; Layer 1.

### 5.4 The simplex fibres in Waldhausen additivity

For the subobject map δS₂C→δC and y∈δ_nC, define F_y=Δ[n]×_{δC}δS₂C. Its m-simplices are monotone u:[m]→[n] and a cofibration sequence u*y↣D↠B in S_mC. Quotient gives p_y:F_y→δC. The constant last-vertex map and 0↣B=B give a section q_y, since every vertex restriction of an S_n-object is zero. Prove p_yq_y=id and make these constructions natural in y.

Use the induced cofibration structure on S₂C, and the actual simplicial pullback.

(Waldhausen, Proof of L 1.4.3, pp.337–338.)

Use:

- `AdditivityFibre`: simplicial pullback over y of the subobject projection.
- `AdditivityFibre.quotient`: Its map p_y to the quotient filtration.
- `AdditivityFibre.lastVertexSection`: section q_y at the last vertex with zero subobject.
- `AdditivityFibre.quotient_section`: p_y∘q_y=id.

**Checks.**

- For n=0 and y=0, F_y parametrizes 0↣B=B and p_y is the quotient identification.
- On q_y(B), the quotient is exactly B, rather than the zero object.
- For the filtration 0↣k↣k², the middle object of a fibre extension may be larger than u*y; the fibre is not the set of subobjects of y.

*Needs:* §5.2; §5.3.

### 5.5 The pushout contraction of an additivity fibre

For v:[m]→[1], replace u(j) by n at indices with v(j)=1, leaving the other indices unchanged. The monotone comparison u≤ū induces u*y→ū*y, and cobase change of the fibre extension defines a simplicial homotopy id_{F_y}≃q_yp_y. Prove its endpoint formulas, simplicial compatibility, constancy on the section, and preservation of the quotient B. p_y and q_y are homotopy inverses.

Choose pushouts coherently to obtain simplicial S-diagrams.

(Waldhausen, Proof of the sublemma–L 1.4.3, pp.339–340.)

*Needs:* §5.4; §5.2.

### 5.6 Object S-additivity

Prove |δS₂C|≃|δC|×|δC| through the subobject and quotient maps, using the simplex-fibre contractions and the simplicial version of Theorem B. This is an additivity theorem already for categories with cofibrations, before choosing weak equivalences.

C is small with cofibrations. No saturation, cylinder or extension axiom is involved.

(Waldhausen, L 1.4.3 and L 1.4.A–B, pp.336–338.)

*Needs:* §5.5; §5.3; Layer 1.

### 5.7 The K-theory space of a Waldhausen category

For small Waldhausen C, define K(C)=Ω|nerve(wS_•C)| at the zero diagram and K_n(C)=π_{n+1}|wS_•C|. Prove its degree-zero component group is Waldhausen K₀, with the weak-equivalence and cofibration relations. Exact functors give based maps and natural exact isomorphisms give homotopies. Coproduct supplies the H-space operation. Form the multisimplicial iterates S^rC; their delooping maps and their spectrum belong to §5.11.

Use diagonal realization of the nerve and S directions; no cylinder, saturation or extension is needed.

(Weibel IV, P 8.4 and D 8.5, p.IV.68;Infinite Loop Structure 8.5.5, p.IV.69.)

Use:

- `WaldhausenCategory.KSpace`: K-theory space.
- `WaldhausenCategory.KGroup`: Its K-groups, with the stated shift.
- `WaldhausenCategory.pi1_eq_K0`: fundamental group of the realisation is the Grothendieck group.
- `WaldhausenCategory.KSpace_map`: map induced by an exact functor.
- `WaldhausenCategory.hSpace`: H-space structure from the coproduct.
- `WaldhausenCategory.iteratedS`: The degreewise multisimplicial S^n construction; §5.11 gives deloopings.

**Checks.**

- The zero Waldhausen category has a contractible K-space.
- For finite-dimensional k-spaces, π₀K=ℤ while |wC| has components ℕ; its map to K is not a homotopy equivalence.
- For exact C with isomorphisms as weak equivalences, the comparison of §5.9 identifies these groups with Q-theory.
- The two-term identity complex has class zero with quasi-isomorphisms, pinning the shift K₀=π₁|wS|.

*Needs:* §5.2; `CategoryTheory.nerve`; `SSet.toTop`; `HomotopyGroup`.

### 5.8 Edgewise S/Q diagrams

For a small exact A, send an S_{2n+1}-filtration on n′<⋯<0′<0<⋯<n to the Q-chain whose jth vertex is A_{j′,j}. Its j→j+1 arrow is the span A_{j′,j}↞A_{(j+1)′,j}↣A_{(j+1)′,j+1}. On isomorphisms this gives a degreewise equivalence iS_{2n+1}A→iQ_nA. Construct its inverse by choosing representatives and quotients, and prove compatibility with the edgewise face and degeneracy maps.

iQ_n is the groupoid of Q-chains and component isomorphisms. S retains quotient choices; Q quotients middle terms by their isomorphisms.

(Waldhausen, §1.9, pp.375–376.)

Use:

- `SConstruction.edgewiseQ`: simplicial functor given by diagonal subquotients and the spans.
- `SConstruction.edgewiseQ_degreeEquiv`: degree-n equivalence iS_{2n+1}A≌iQ_nA.
- `SConstruction.edgewiseQ_faces`: Face operators agree with span composition by the intermediate pullback square.
- `SConstruction.edgewiseQ_degeneracies`: Duplicating an index inserts an identity Q-arrow.

**Checks.**

- At n=0 the construction takes an S₁-object to the same A-object.
- For the length-three filtration 0⊂k⊂k²⊂k³, the edgewise Q-arrow goes from a rank-one interval quotient to a rank-three interval quotient through the rank-two quotient; its deflation is not oriented forward.
- A degenerate filtration produces an identity Q-span after quotient identifications; an automorphism is retained as an isomorphism of the Q-chain.

*Needs:* §5.2; §2.1; `ExactStructure.conflation_baseChange`; Layer 1.

### 5.9 Comparison of the S-construction with the Q-construction

Combine the degreewise edgewise equivalence of §5.8 with subdivision invariance and the isomorphism-double-nerve comparison to obtain |iS_•A|≃BQA. Prove naturality for exact functors and identify the loop representing an automorphism with its Q representative. This construction precedes additivity and uses neither relative delooping nor a spectrum.

A is small exact, with inflations as cofibrations and isomorphisms as weak equivalences.

(Weibel IV, §8.6, p.IV.69;E 8.5(c) and the opening of E 8.6, p.IV.74;Waldhausen, §1.9, pp.375–376.)

*Needs:* §5.7; §2.5; §5.8; §5.3; Layer 1.

### 5.10 Additivity for Waldhausen categories

For small Waldhausen C, prove |wS_•S₂C|→|wS_•C|×|wS_•C|, induced by subobject and quotient, is a homotopy equivalence. Pass from object-S additivity to the weak-map nerve direction using the gluing axiom. A cofibration sequence of exact functors induces a homotopy K(F)≃K(F′)+K(F″). When a cylinder satisfying its axiom is present, apply this to identity, cone and suspension to obtain K(cone)≃0 and K(Σ)≃−id.

Functor cofibrations satisfy the pushout comparison condition. Additivity needs no cylinder, saturation or extension; cone/suspension consequences use a cylinder.

(Weibel V, Additivity T 1.2 and Example 1.2.3, p.V.2;Waldhausen, T 1.4.2, p.336.)

*Needs:* §5.2; §5.7; Layer 1; §5.6.

### 5.11 Relative S-delooping and spectra

For an exact F:B→C, define S_nF=S_nB×_{S_nC}S_{n+1}C, using ∂₀ on the last factor; equality in this pullback can be replaced by compatible isomorphism data. The fibre over the zero B-diagram includes C through constant filtrations. Degreewise additivity yields the relative sequence |wS_•C|→|wS_•(S_•F)|→|wS_•(S_•B)|. Prove its realization is a homotopy fibration: its level bases and total spaces are connected, and the nerve realizations have cellular degeneracies. For F=id the relative simplicial path object is contractible by its extra degeneracy; its degree-zero category is not generally zero. It gives |wS^rC|≃Ω|wS^{r+1}C| for r≥1. Assemble the spaces K(C), |wS_•C|, |wS²C|,… into the connective Ω-spectrum using §1.7. Define relative K(F)=Ω²|wS_•(S_•F)|, with its compatible fibre comparison.

B,C are small Waldhausen and F exact. The realization-fibration argument uses connected proper simplicial CW spaces.

(Weibel V, P 1.7;its proof, p.V.8;E 1.7, p.V.10;Weibel IV, Relative K-theory spaces 8.5.3 and L 8.5.4, p.IV.69;Infinite Loop Structure 8.5.5, p.IV.69.)

*Needs:* §5.10; §5.2; §5.7; Layer 1.

### 5.12 Non-functorial Waldhausen factorizations

Define the factorization property by the existence, for every f:X→Y, of X↣Z→Y with first map a cofibration and second map a weak equivalence. This is a property of the Waldhausen structure; it includes neither an assigned functorial Z nor cylinder data. Apply it to X→0 to produce a cone and suspension usable in cofinality arguments.

C is small Waldhausen. Every later result explicitly names saturation or extension when needed.

(Schlichting 2003, Appendix A.1 and A.5 p.24–25;Remark11.2 p.20.)

Use:

- `Waldhausen.HasFactorization`: Every map admits the cofibration–weak-equivalence composite.
- `Waldhausen.HasFactorization.factor`: Existential intermediate object, cofibration and weak arrow.
- `Waldhausen.HasFactorization.ofCylinder`: The cylinder axiom implies factorization.

**Checks.**

- Bounded complexes with monomorphism cofibrations and quasi-isomorphisms factor through their mapping cylinder.
- With isomorphisms as weak equivalences, the property would force every map to be a cofibration; ordinary vector spaces with injection cofibrations fail it for k→0.
- In the zero category the identity factorization supplies the property without any nontrivial cylinder choice.

*Needs:* §5.1.

### 5.13 Cofibrant diagrams on a finite poset

For finite P, define a relative cofibration X→Y by the latching colimit over ({0}×{p})∪([1]×P_{<p}) and the cofibration from this colimit to Y_p, for every p. Define a cofibrant diagram by 0→X having this property. Its colimit is built by adjoining minimal remaining vertices with pushouts along cofibrations. Pointwise weak equivalences and relative latching cofibrations equip the full subcategory of cofibrant diagrams with a Waldhausen structure. The ambient category C^P need not have all latching colimits for arbitrary objects.

P is finite. Induct over predecessor-closed subsets, constructing relative latching colimits by cofibration pushouts.

(Schlichting 2003, Appendix A.6–A.8 pp.25–26.)

Use:

- `CofibrantPosetDiagram`: finite-poset diagram with the latching cofibrations.
- `CofibrantPosetDiagram.latching`: relative colimit at each vertex.
- `CofibrantPosetDiagram.colimit`: colimit exists and is built by cofibration pushouts.
- `CofibrantPosetDiagram.structural_cof`: Cofibrancy preserves structural cofibrations.
- `CofibrantPosetDiagram.map`: Relative-latching cofibrations of diagram maps.

**Checks.**

- For a one-point P, relative cofibrations are exactly those of C.
- For the chain 0<1, a cofibrant diagram is X₀↣X₁; a relative cofibration also requires X₁∪_{X₀}Y₀↣Y₁.
- For the diamond with two incomparable predecessors, the latching object contains their pushout over their common predecessor; checking only each individual arrow misses that map.

*Needs:* §5.1.

### 5.14 Swallowing a second weak-map nerve direction

For a wide subcategory A⊂B, form the double category of commuting squares, with vertical arrows in A and horizontal arrows in B. Prove that the inclusion of constant vertical strings from nerve B induces a realization equivalence: an n-string has a contraction to its first term in the horizontal direction. Apply this to weak-map diagrams of S_nC, eliminating an extra nerve direction in the stabilized pairing.

All objects occur in both A and B, identities belong to A, and square compositions stay in the classes. Use the diagonal/iterated realization comparison.

(Waldhausen, Swallowing L 1.6.5, p.352/PDF35;pairing paragraph p.342/PDF25.)

*Needs:* Layer 1.

### Examples

For 0↣k↣k² the three S₂ faces have ranks 1,2,1. The latching map detects cofibration conditions that objectwise injectivity on the displayed filtration misses. The complex k --id→ k has K₀ class zero with quasi-isomorphisms.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–2 and exact additivity from Layer 4; finite ordinal diagrams, pushouts and weak-equivalence nerves.

## Layer 6: Fibration, approximation and cofinality

### 6.1 Trivial-cofibration comparison

In a saturated Waldhausen category with a cylinder satisfying its axiom, prove B(cof∩w)→B(wC) is a homotopy equivalence. Both categories have all C-objects. Factor a weak map by its cylinder and use the resulting functorial zigzags to contract the relevant comma categories. The maps from both cylinder ends are cofibrations, and saturation makes the required ones weak equivalences.

Use the natural cylinder with its pushout cofibrations, weak projection and saturation; §6.13 handles existential factorizations.

(Weibel IV, E 8.15, p.IV.75;Waldhausen L 1.6.3 proof is the same cylinder contraction.)

*Needs:* §5.1; Layer 1.

### 6.2 Relative S-localization comparison

For v⊂w and F:(C^w,v)→(C,v), identify S_nF with the category of length-n strings of w-cofibrations by forgetting the chosen quotient data. In the extra S_m direction, identify the v-map diagrams. Prove these are equivalences of the relative diagrams, natural in both indices, and hence |vS_•S_•F|≃|v·co_w,•S_•C|, preserving the inclusion of |vS_•C|.

C^w has 0→X∈w. The v,w structures share cofibrations; saturation and extension characterize w-cofibrations by w-acyclic quotient.

(Weibel V, Proof of T 2.1, pp.V.12–13.)

*Needs:* §5.2; §5.11; §5.1; Layer 1.

### 6.3 The Waldhausen localisation (fibration) theorem

Let v⊂w be weak equivalences on the same category with cofibrations. If the w-structure is saturated, satisfies extension, and has a cylinder satisfying its axiom, prove K(C^w,v)→K(C,v)→K(C,w) is a homotopy-fibre sequence. Identify the nullhomotopy through the w-acyclic objects and use the relative-S comparison and trivial-cofibration nerve theorem. The sequence includes the higher boundary and the right-exact ending K₀(C^w,v)→K₀(C,v)→K₀(C,w)→0.

Use inherited cofibrations and v-equivalences on C^w. Saturation, extension and the cylinder axiom concern w.

(Weibel V, Waldhausen Localization T 2.1, p.V.12;T 2.6.3 and Caveat 7.1.1, pp.V.17 and V.52.)

*Needs:* §5.11; §5.1; §6.1; §6.2; Layer 1.

### 6.4 Approximation lifts filtered objects

For an exact F:A→B satisfying approximation, lift a map from F of a finite filtration by induction on its length. At each step use a cofibration factorization from App2, then pushout and gluing to extend the comparisons to all quotient squares. Prove S_nF reflects weak equivalences and has App2 for every n.

App1 says a map is weak exactly when its F-image is weak. App2 factors any F(A)→B as F of a cofibration followed by a weak equivalence. Weak maps in S_n are objectwise.

(Waldhausen, L 1.6.6, p.353.)

*Needs:* §5.2; §5.1.

### 6.5 Iterated mapping cylinders of a simplex diagram

Build a cylinder T(A₀→⋯→A_n) recursively: start with A₀, and take the mapping cylinder of the preceding cylinder’s projection followed by A_{n−1}→A_n. Construct its projection to A_n and the maps from cylinders of every face. These form a diagram on the nondegenerate face poset. When the string maps are weak equivalences, each face map and final projection is a weak equivalence.

The cylinder satisfies pushout/cofibration exactness and its weak-projection axiom. Face maps use its projections coherently.

(Waldhausen, Proof of T 1.6.7, pp.356–357.)

Use:

- `IteratedCylinder`: recursive cylinder object of a composable string.
- `IteratedCylinder.projection`: natural weak-equivalence projection to the final vertex.
- `IteratedCylinder.face`: Compatible cylinder maps for nondegenerate faces.
- `IteratedCylinder.face_comp`: face identities and their naturality.
- `Approximation.cylinderDiagram`: functor T_q to wF/B and its projection to q_*.

**Checks.**

- For a one-vertex string, T(A)=A and the projection is id.
- For id_A, both endpoints enter its mapping cylinder by cofibrations and the projection is weak.
- For the two-vertex identity string on k[0], the mapping cylinder projects quasi-isomorphically to k[0]; k[0]⊕k[0]→k[0] is not a quasi-isomorphism.

*Needs:* §5.1; Layer 1.

### 6.6 Cylinder extension over boundaries

Extend the iterated-cylinder diagram on the faces of a finite nonsingular simplicial set X to its finite simplicial subsets. In F↓B, inclusions become cofibrations and unions become pushouts. Prove in particular t(∂x)↣t(x) is a cofibration for every nondegenerate simplex x. The extension is constructed in F↓B; unions need not retain the weak-equivalence map to B required in wF↓B.

Use the cylinder pushout cofibration axiom and the finite face-poset induction. Nonsingularity prevents repeated vertices from invalidating that poset model.

(Waldhausen, Proof of the sublemma–T 1.6.7, pp.357–358.)

*Needs:* §6.5; §5.1.

### 6.7 Cylinder comma contractions

For F with approximation and a source cylinder, contract B(wF↓B) for each B-object. Represent a map of a finite subdivided sphere through a nonsingular finite face poset, apply the cylinder-boundary construction to extend it over a cone, and compare the extension with the original weak diagram. Simplicial approximation and CW Whitehead conclude contractibility.

A,B are saturated; F is exact and satisfies App1/App2; A has a cylinder satisfying its axiom. Comma comparisons F(A)→B are weak.

(Waldhausen, T 1.6.7, pp.354–359.)

*Needs:* §6.5; §6.6; Layer 1.

### 6.8 The Approximation theorem

If an exact F:A→B reflects weak equivalences and satisfies App2, between saturated small Waldhausen categories, and A has a cylinder satisfying its axiom, prove |wS_•F| and K(F) are homotopy equivalences. Apply the contracted weak comma categories first to wF and then to S_nF. The source cylinder hypothesis is part of the theorem, rather than inferred from App2.

App2 permits a cofibration A↣A′ and a weak equivalence F(A′)→B whose composite is the given F(A)→B. The saturated structures are both named.

(Weibel V, Waldhausen Approximation T 2.4;its proof, p.V.15;Changing cofibrations 2.5.1, p.V.16;Waldhausen, T 1.6.7, pp.354–359.)

*Needs:* §6.3; §5.1; §6.7; §6.4; Layer 1.

### 6.9 The Gillet-Waldhausen comparison

Let E be a full extension-closed subcategory of an abelian M, closed under kernels of M-surjections between E-objects, with its induced exact structure. The inclusion in bounded complexes concentrated at degree zero induces K(E)≃K(Chᵇ(E),qis). Cofibrations are degreewise admissible inflations, and quasi-isomorphisms are computed in M. Prove comparison with the mapping cylinder and the fibration/approximation results. Its acyclic complexes agree with admissibly exact complexes under this closure hypothesis.

Use an explicit ambient abelian category and induced exact structure, with quasi-isomorphisms. Neither an embedding of every exact category nor replacement by chain homotopy equivalences is assumed.

(Weibel V, T 2.2 (Gillet-Waldhausen);proof, p.V.13;Remark 2.2.1, p.V.14.)

*Needs:* §6.8; §6.3; §2.5; `ExactStructure.abelian`; `ExactStructure.fullSubcategory`.

### 6.10 Finite-poset factorization

Assume C has factorization. A map X→Y of arbitrary diagrams on a finite poset factors as a relative latching cofibration X↣Z followed by a pointwise weak equivalence Z→Y. Construct Z inductively from relative latching colimits. The relative construction does not require existence of each predecessor colimit of X separately; the theorem does not assume X is a cofibrant diagram.

P is finite and factorization existential; this gives neither functorial factorization nor a Waldhausen structure on all C^P.

(Schlichting 2003, Appendix A.9 p.26.)

*Needs:* §5.12; §5.13.

### 6.11 Contract the approximation comma categories

For saturated A,B, an exact F with App1/App2 and factorization in A has contractible weak comma categories wF↓B. Replace a finite-poset diagram X there by a cofibrant Y→X. Its colimit exists and F preserves it. Apply App2 to F(colim Y)→B, obtaining F(Z)→B weak. Reflection and saturation make Y→const Z pointwise weak. Thus X←Y→const Z contracts the diagram; finite-poset detection contracts the comma realization.

Factorization is required only in A. App2 uses the source cofibrations and a weak map to the B-object; saturation controls all comparison arrows.

(Schlichting 2003, Proof of Approximation A.2 and L A.10 pp.26–27.)

*Needs:* §6.10; Layer 1.

### 6.12 Approximation with factorizations

Under App1/App2 and saturation, with factorization in the source, an exact F induces realization equivalences on wA→wB and wS_•A→wS_•B, hence on K-spaces. Prove S_n version using §6.4 and finite-poset factorization. No functorial cylinder or factorization in the target is required.

A and B are small Waldhausen with saturated weak equivalences. The source has the existential factorization property of §5.12.

(Schlichting 2003, Appendix A.2 p.24 and its proof pp.26–27.)

*Needs:* §6.11; §6.4; Layer 1.

### 6.13 Acyclic-cofibration comparison

For saturated C with factorization, prove B(cof∩w)→B(wC) is a homotopy equivalence. The proof uses finite-poset replacements and the comma contraction, allowing independent choices for each finite diagram. Thus it extends §6.1 to structures with no specified cylinder functor.

C is saturated and has existential factorization. The conclusion is realization equivalence, not equality of morphism classes.

(Schlichting 2003, Appendix A.11 p.27.)

*Needs:* §6.10; §5.13; Layer 1.

### 6.14 Fibration with factorizations

Replace the cylinder hypothesis in §6.3 by factorization in (C,w). With saturation and extension for w, prove K(C^w,v)→K(C,v)→K(C,w) is a homotopy-fibre sequence and that K₀(C,v)→K₀(C,w) is onto. Use §6.13 in the relative-S proof; v-factorizations are unnecessary.

v⊂w give small Waldhausen structures on the same cofibration category. The acyclic subcategory is defined by 0→X∈w, with the inherited v-structure.

(Schlichting 2003, Appendix A.3 p.25 and its proof p.27.)

*Needs:* §6.13; §6.10; §6.4; §6.2; §5.11; Layer 1.

### 6.15 Weak equivalences detected by a Grothendieck quotient

For a surjective homomorphism p:K₀(C,v)→G to an abelian group, define w_p to contain every morphism f:A→B with p[A]=p[B]. For a cofibration this means p[B/A]=0. Prove v⊂w_p, gluing, saturation and extension, and retain the original factorization as a w_p-factorization. Its acyclic objects form C₀={A:p[A]=0}. Factoring A→0 supplies representatives for additive inverses, which is needed to realize all G-classes by objects.

C is pointed, has v-factorization and p is onto. The new weak class compares endpoint classes.

(Thomason–Trobaugh, T 1.10.1 and full proof, pp.275–277/PDF15–16.)

Use:

- `KTheory.classWeakEquivalences`: map lies in w_p exactly when p[B]=p[A].
- `KTheory.classWeakEquivalences_cof`: On cofibrations it is the zero class of the quotient.
- `KTheory.classWeakEquivalences_contains`: original weak equivalences are contained in w_p.
- `KTheory.classWeakEquivalences_saturated`: Saturation, extension and gluing for w_p.
- `KTheory.classAcyclic`: acyclic objects are exactly the kernel-class objects.

**Checks.**

- For p=0 every map is in w_p and every object is acyclic.
- For bounded k-complexes and p=Euler rank, k[0]→0 is not weak but 0→(k --id→ k) is weak.
- A morphism between complexes of equal Euler rank belongs to w_p even when it is not a quasi-isomorphism; for k[0]⊕k[1]→0 this distinguishes the new class.

*Needs:* §5.12; §5.7.

### 6.16 The class-weak S-construction realizes the quotient group

Send a length-n S-filtration to the n successive increments of its p-class in G^n. Prove w_pS_nC→G^n has contractible fibres and realizes to a homotopy equivalence. The face maps add adjacent increments or remove an end, and degeneracies insert zero; hence these equivalences identify |w_pS_•C| with BG.

Use the surjective p and source factorization of §6.15. G^n is discrete, and this is a statement about every degree before the total realization.

(Thomason–Trobaugh, T 1.10.1 and full proof, pp.275–277/PDF15–16.)

*Needs:* §6.15; §6.4; §5.2; Layer 1.

### 6.17 Cofinality with non-functorial factorizations

Apply factorization fibration to v⊂w_p. Looping the BG comparison gives K(C₀,v)→K(C,v)→G_discrete as a homotopy-fibre sequence. Thus K_i(C₀,v)→K_i(C,v) is an isomorphism for i>0 and K₀(C₀,v) identifies with ker p. Use complements to recover the general cofinal-subcategory statement and retain its degree-zero correction.

C,p,G and C₀ satisfy §6.15. The discrete target carries its abelian group structure, and its map on components is exactly p.

(Thomason–Trobaugh, T 1.10.1 and full proof, pp.275–277/PDF15–16.)

*Needs:* §6.16; §6.14; Layer 1.

### 6.18 Cofinality and K₀

For an extension-closed full exact subcategory A⊂B that is cofinal under direct sum, identify BQA with the covering of BQB associated with K₀(A)⊂K₀(B). On K_n the induced map is an isomorphism for n>0 and injective for n=0. In the Waldhausen setting the fibre sequence ends in the discrete quotient K₀(B)/K₀(A). For A→A^♮ this proves positive-degree invariance but retains the possible proper degree-zero subgroup.

Every B-object has a B-complement with sum in A. Waldhausen versions retain saturation, weak-equivalence closure and the cylinder/factorization requirements of §6.17.

(Weibel IV, Cofinality 6.4.1, p.IV.56;E 6.6 (Gersten), p.IV.60, and Waldhausen Cofinality 8.9, p.IV.72;Weibel V, Cofinality T 2.3, p.V.14.)

*Needs:* §6.3; §5.11; §5.9; Layer 1; `CategoryTheory.Idempotents.Karoubi`.

### Examples

Vector spaces with injection cofibrations and only isomorphism weak equivalences fail factorization on k→0. Mapping cylinders supply it for complexes with quasi-isomorphisms. Class weak equivalences for Euler rank allow k[0]⊕k[1]→0, even though this is not a quasi-isomorphism.

### Dependencies

Layers 1 and 5; saturation and the indicated cylinder or factorization hypothesis.

## Layer 7: Products and transfers

### 7.1 The bisimplicial S-grid of a biexact functor

Given A∈S_mA and B∈S_nB, the diagram with entry F(A_{ij},B_{kl}) defines an S_mS_nC object. Check every quotient pushout and relative latching cofibration using the joint pushout-product condition. Weak maps in either variable give the two weak-nerve directions. Construct grid maps naturally in the two simplex variables, with the zero faces mapped to zero.

F is biexact between small Waldhausen categories, including the joint cofibration condition of §7.4.

(Waldhausen, §1.5 pairing paragraph, p.342/PDF25.)

Use:

- `BiexactSGrid`: F:S_mA×S_nB→S_mS_nC with the joint latching condition.
- `BiexactSGrid.simplex_natural`: Compatibility with both simplicial directions.
- `BiexactSGrid.zero_left`: zero input gives a zero grid.
- `BiexactSGrid.pushoutProduct`: grid latching map is the pushout product.

**Checks.**

- For m=n=1 the sole nonzero entry is F(A,B).
- If one input filtration is the zero filtration, every grid entry is zero.
- For two flags of k-spaces whose increments have dimensions (1,2) and (2,1), the double increments have dimensions 2,1,4,2; replacing the grid by direct sums would give different values.

*Needs:* §5.7; §5.2.

### 7.2 Stabilization of pairings

Realize the double S-grid, remove its redundant weak direction by §5.14, and pass through the two delooping maps to obtain a stable pairing K(A)∧K(B)→K(C). Prove independence of the chosen representing S-levels and bilinearity of the induced K_i(A)⊗K_j(B)→K_{i+j}(C). On object classes its value is [F(A,B)].

Use small Waldhausen inputs and the complete biexactness data. No direct one-fold Q functor is substituted for the double construction.

(Waldhausen, §1.5 pairing paragraph, p.342/PDF25.)

*Needs:* §7.1; §5.14; §5.11; Layer 1.

### 7.3 Transport biexact natural isomorphisms to pairing homotopies

An exact natural isomorphism of biexact composites gives a homotopy of the associated stable pairings. Transport the associator, unit and symmetry diagrams of the input functors through the S-grid, and prove their coherence under further iteration. Sphere interchange contributes (−1)^{ij} on degree-i and degree-j classes. A binary symmetry homotopy by itself is insufficient for an E∞ assertion.

The diagrams of input natural isomorphisms, not only their existence, are part of the coherence data. Use §1.8 for suspension and sphere signs.

(Waldhausen, §1.5 pairing paragraph, p.342/PDF25.)

*Needs:* §7.2; Layer 1.

### 7.4 External products from biexact functors: the K-theoretic pairing and its coherence

Construct a spectrum pairing K(A)∧K(B)→K(C) from a biexact functor. On exact categories, require exactness in each variable and zero when either input is zero. On Waldhausen categories additionally require the pushout-product map F(A′,B)∪_{F(A,B)}F(A,B′)→F(A′,B′) to be a cofibration. Use the double S-grid and its stabilization, rather than claiming a direct functor QA×QB→QC realizes the desired degree-adding pairing. The induced product is bilinear K_i(A)⊗K_j(B)→K_{i+j}(C), with [a]·[b]=[F(a,b)]. Coherent associators, units and symmetries of the input functors give the coherent homotopies. For k-algebras A,B over a commutative k, tensor product gives the external pairing into K(A⊗_k B); for commutative R it gives the internal product with unit [R].

Use small biexact inputs with the joint cofibration condition. External projective tensor pairings need neither commuting nor k-flat algebras. An E∞ claim requires all symmetric monoidal coherence.

(Weibel, II.7, 'Products', and L 7.4, p.132;II.9.5.2, p.165;II.7.4.1 (Application 7.4.1), p.132;IV.6.6, p.322;IV.8.11 (Products), p.342.)

Use:

- `KTheory.biexactPairing`: pairing induced by a biexact functor.
- `KTheory.biexactPairing_natural`: Naturality in exact maps and transformations, compatible with variablewise fibre sequences.
- `KTheory.biexactPairing_K0`: In degree zero the pairing sends [A] ⊗ [B] to [F(A, B)].
- `KTheory.externalProduct`: external product of the K-groups of two algebras.
- `KTheory.mul`: internal product for a commutative ring.
- `KTheory.mul_assoc`: associativity homotopy.
- `KTheory.mul_one`: unit homotopy, with unit the class of the ring.
- `KTheory.mul_comm_graded`: symmetry homotopy, giving graded commutativity.

**Checks.**

- For finite-dimensional k-spaces of dimensions 2 and 3, the product class is 6 in K₀(k)=ℤ.
- Tensoring with R is the identity, while tensoring with zero gives the zero map.
- The direct-sum bifunctor is not a pairing input: F(A,0)=A for A≠0.
- The symmetry on degree-one classes has sign −1, whereas the degree-zero comparison has sign +1.

*Needs:* §2.5; §3.2; §5.7; §5.9; §5.11; Layer 1; `SplitK0.of_mul_of`; `SplitK0`; `TensorProduct`; §7.2; §7.3.

### 7.5 The total K-group is a graded-commutative ring

For a commutative ring R, use the symmetry homotopy of its tensor pairing and the interchange of the degree-p and degree-q spheres to prove xy=(−1)^{pq}yx on connective K-groups. The sign is forced by that sphere interchange. In degree one, products of unit classes anticommute; this does not force their squares to vanish in a group with 2-torsion. The nonconnective extension uses the Bass spectrum and the compatible extended pairing of §13.7.

R is commutative and p,q≥0 for the connective statement. Tensor coherence is part of the construction, rather than an extra unproved commutativity assertion.

(Weibel, IV.1.10 (T 1.10, Loday), p.266;V.8.2, p.430.)

**Checks.**

- For p=q=0, the sign is +1 and the product is symmetric.
- For p=q=1, the sign is −1; for p=1,q=2 it is +1.
- At p=q=1, the equality x²=−x² implies only 2x²=0; characteristic 2 does not justify discarding possible integral 2-torsion.

*Needs:* §7.4; Layer 1.

### 7.6 Units and the K₀ tensor comparison

Compare the degree-zero tensor pairing with the split K₀ multiplication by checking the value [P⊗_R Q] on projective generators. For u∈R×, stabilization of the one-by-one invertible matrix gives [u]∈K₁(R); multiplication by it maps K_n(R) to K_{n+1}(R). Since [u⁻¹]=−[u], the inverse unit gives the negative degree-raising map, rather than an inverse operator.

R is commutative and P,Q finite projective; unit classes use GL₁→GL→GL/E.

(Weibel, II.7.4.1 (Application 7.4.1), p.132;III.1.1.1 (Example 1.1.1, SK1), p.180.)

**Checks.**

- For P=R²,Q=R³, the degree-zero product is [R⁶].
- Multiplication by the class of 1∈R× is zero because [1]=0 in K₁(R).
- Multiplication by [u⁻¹] is the negative of multiplication by [u] and still raises the degree.

*Needs:* §7.4; `SplitK0.of_mul_of`; `SplitK0`.

### 7.7 Transfer maps and the projection formula

Let f:R→S have S as a left R-module with a finite resolution by finite projectives. Restriction carries modules with finite finite-projective resolutions over S into the analogous R-category. Compose that exact functor with the two resolution equivalences to define Tr_f:K_n(S)→K_n(R). Prove composition when both restrictions have this finiteness property. For commutative rings and x∈K_i(R), y∈K_j(S), prove Tr_f(f^*x·y)=x·Tr_f(y) by the tensor/restriction comparison. This statement uses the full connective pairing, not just the K₀ action.

i,j≥0; resolutions have finitely generated terms, stronger than finite projective dimension. The internal projection formula needs commutativity.

(Weibel V, V.3.2 and V.3.3.2, p.V.21;V.3.3.2, p.V.21, projection-formula paragraph.)

*Needs:* §4.6; §4.3; §2.6; §7.4.

### 7.8 Base change of a finite field transfer through an Artin algebra

For finite E/F and any field extension F′/F, write E⊗_F F′=∏_j B_j with residue fields E_j and lengths ℓ_j=length_{B_j}B_j. Prove res_{F′/F}∘Tr_{E/F}=Σ_j ℓ_j Tr_{E_j/F′}∘res_{E_j/E} on K_n, n≥0. The tensor/restriction square gives the base-change functor, and a composition series of each B_j gives its multiplicity by additivity. Nilpotence exponents are not substituted for the module lengths.

B is finite-dimensional over F′ and may be nonreduced. F′/F may be infinite or transcendental. E→E_j is the induced field map.

(Weibel V, Examples 3.5.3 and 3.7.2, pp.V.23–25;Example 4.2.1, p.V.34.)

*Needs:* §4.3; §7.7; §3.1.

### Examples

The tensor pairing of ranks 2 and 3 has rank 6. The unit 1 has zero K₁ class and therefore gives a zero degree-raising operation. A finite field extension transfer sends [L] to [L:k][k], including inseparable extensions.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–6, tensor products and exact or Waldhausen biexact functors.

## Layer 8: Relative theory and low-degree excision

### 8.1 Relative K-theory as a homotopy fibre

For a unital f:R→S, define RelK(f)=fib(K(R)→K(S)) at zero, and RelK_n(f)=π_nRelK(f) for n≥0. For a two-sided ideal I use the quotient map and write K(R,I). The functorial infinite-loop structure gives abelian groups even in relative degree zero. Construct long exact sequence and the maps for commuting squares. For an exact functor of Waldhausen categories, compare this fibre with Ω²|wS_•S_•F|; the extra component term of its relative-S model records coker(K₀F) in degree −1.

Ring maps are unital, ideals two-sided. Relative S uses §5.11; identifying relative K₁ with a congruence quotient requires a further comparison.

(Weibel IV, Relative groups 1.11.1, p.IV.8;E 1.15, p.IV.16.)

Use:

- `relativeK`: relative K-theory space of a ring map.
- `relativeK.group`: relative groups.
- `relativeK.addCommGroup`: Their abelian group structure, degree zero included.
- `relativeK.les`: long exact sequence with the absolute groups.
- `relativeK.ofPair`: The quotient-map fibre for a two-sided ideal; §8.9 gives the degree-zero adapter.
- `relativeK.waldhausen`: Waldhausen relative theory and its extra term.

**Checks.**

- RelK(id_R) is contractible.
- For R→0 the relative groups are K_n(R).
- The degree-zero exact sequence contains K₁(S)→RelK₀(f); RelK₀(f) is therefore not generally just ker(K₀R→K₀S).

*Needs:* §3.2; §5.11; Layer 1; `Ideal.Quotient.ring`.

### 8.2 Relative K-theory is not support K-theory

Distinguish the fibre of K(R)→K(R/I) from a localization fibre supported on a closed subset. The relative space has a component map into K₀(R) with image ker(K₀(R)→K₀(R/I)); its components fit into the full exact sequence containing K₁(R/I). In general K₀(R)→K₀(R/I) need not be onto. A Serre or Waldhausen localization has its own acyclic category as fibre, under its named hypotheses; a ring quotient by an ideal alone does not supply that category or its equivalence to the relative fibre.

I is two-sided. There is no regularity, idempotent-lifting or localization assumption.

(Weibel V, T 2.6.3, p.V.17;Caveat 7.1.1, p.V.52.)

**Checks.**

- For I=0 the relative fibre is contractible.
- For I=R the target is the zero ring and the relative fibre is K(R).
- For R=k[x] and I=(x(x−1)), K₀(R)=ℤ maps diagonally into K₀(k×k)=ℤ²; it is not surjective, and the missing components are visible in the fibre sequence.

*Needs:* §8.1; §6.3; §6.8.

### 8.3 Nonunital rings, the unitisation and the comparison with the unital theory

Use the canonical augmentation ℤ⋉I→ℤ to define connective K-theory of a nonunital associative ring I as its relative homotopy fibre. A nonunital homomorphism induces a map of these fibres. If I is unital, (z,a)↦(z,z·1_I+a) identifies its unitization with ℤ×I and identifies the fibre with K(I). If I embeds as a two-sided ideal in R, the square from ℤ⋉I→R and ℤ→R/I gives a comparison to K(R,I); prove naturality of that map without assuming excision.

Nonunital maps preserve addition and multiplication; ideals are two-sided. Use Unitization ℤ I.

(Weibel IV, Absolute Excision 1.11.2, p.IV.9.)

Use:

- `nonunitalK`: K-theory of a nonunital ring through its unitisation.
- `nonunitalK.map`: Functoriality in maps of nonunital rings.
- `nonunitalK.compare`: comparison map to the relative theory of a pair.
- `nonunitalK.of_unital`: Agreement with the usual theory for a unital ring.

**Checks.**

- I=0 gives the fibre of the identity of K(ℤ), hence a contractible space.
- For unital I=ℤ, the augmentation is projection ℤ×ℤ→ℤ and its fibre is the second K(ℤ).
- A square-zero nonunital ring need not satisfy K₁ excision; existence of the comparison map does not imply it is an equivalence.

*Needs:* §8.1; `Unitization`.

### 8.4 Projective patching and its clutching boundary

For R=R₁×_S R₂ with R₂→S surjective, patch right finite-projective P₁,P₂ and an isomorphism α:P₂⊗S≅P₁⊗S by the kernel of (x,y)↦x̄−α(ȳ). Prove patched module is finite projective, its two base changes recover P₁,P₂, and every finite projective R-module is recovered this way. For g∈GL_n(S), define ∂[g]=[Patch(R₁ⁿ,R₂ⁿ,g)]−[Rⁿ]. If g lifts to either chart it patches to Rⁿ and has zero boundary. Patching along g and g⁻¹ gives a free direct sum of rank 2n, ensuring additive inverses and independence of stabilization. The orientation uses α from the second chart to the first, so a matrix a imposes x̄=a ȳ.

(Weibel, Milnor Patching T I.2.7, pp.13–14;E I.2.8, p.16;T II.2.9, pp.78–79;Weibel III, T 2.6, p.III.15.)

Use:

- `MilnorPatch`: compatible-pair kernel module.
- `MilnorPatch.baseChange`: two finite-projective base-change isomorphisms.
- `MilnorPatch.reconstruct`: Recovery of any finite projective over the pullback.
- `MilnorPatch.boundary`: clutching class on stabilized matrices.
- `MilnorPatch.inverse`: direct sum for g and g⁻¹ is free.

**Checks.**

- For g=1 the patched module is Rⁿ and the boundary is zero, including n=0.
- For g=[[1,1],[0,1]] over ℤ and y=(0,1), x=g y=(1,1); g⁻¹y=(−1,1) fails the patch equation.
- Over the cusp k[x²,x³]⊂k[x], its conductor square has a nontrivial clutching class from 1+x in k[x]/x²; projective patching cannot be replaced by ignoring α.

*Needs:* §3.1–3.5; Mathlib RingHom.pullback and finite-projective image modules; supplied projective K₀.

### 8.5 Milnor's sequence is exact at the pair of K₁-groups

For B=S×_C T with φ:S→C onto, prove exactness of K₁(B)→K₁(S)⊕K₁(T)→K₁(C) at the middle term. The maps are the two projections and (x,y)↦φ_*x−ψ_*y. Stabilize representatives so their images agree, lift the required elementary correction through φ, and patch the matching invertible matrices to B. Use the stable GL/E model and its Q comparison.

Only φ must be onto. Equality in stable K₁ requires stabilization, not equality of finite matrices.

(Weibel III, Proof of T 2.6, the last step, p.III.15.)

*Needs:* §3.1–3.5, §8.4; `RingHom.pullback`; `RingHom.pullback_comm_sq`.

### 8.6 Milnor Mayer–Vietoris

Prove natural exact sequence K₁(B)→K₁(S)⊕K₁(T)→K₁(C)→K₀(B)→K₀(S)⊕K₀(T)→K₀(C) at its four interior positions. The middle boundary sends a gluing matrix a to [FreePatch(a)]−n[B], with φ(s)=aψ(t) as the patch convention. Both difference maps use the S-image minus the T-image. Prove representative independence, elementary invariance and additivity of the boundary using projective patching; then prove the remaining exactness with stabilization. Neither exactness to the left of K₁(B) nor surjectivity onto K₀(C) is asserted.

The square is a pullback of unital associative rings with one map onto C. Use projective patching in §8.4, the stable K₁ adapter in §3.14, and the compatible-pair exact functors.

(Weibel III, T 2.6 (Mayer–Vietoris);its proof, p.III.15;Remark 2.2.1 and E 2.3, pp.III.13 and III.16;T 5.8, p.III.41.)

*Needs:* §8.5; §3.2; §3.1–3.5, §8.4; `RingHom.pullback`.

### 8.7 Relative projective triples are components of the K-fibre

For f:R→S, identify the relative split triple group of f_!:P(R)→P(S) with π₀RelK(f). Map (P,α,Q) to [P]−[Q] together with the path from its scalar extension to zero furnished by α. Use stabilized virtual-projective representatives for surjectivity and paths representing stable automorphisms for injectivity. Compare the automorphism boundary with the connecting map from K₁(S).

f is a unital map of associative rings. Only relative degree zero is compared; the degree-one congruence-group comparison is outside this assertion.

(Weibel II, D 2.10,pp.II.13–14;E 2.17,p.II.17;IV E 1.16,p.IV.16.)

*Needs:* §8.1; §4.17; §3.14.

### 8.8 Ideal K-zero through the augmented-ring patching square

For a two-sided I⊂R, let R⋉I be the ring on R×I with (r,i)(s,j)=(rs,rj+is+ij). Its projections p₀(r,i)=r and p₁(r,i)=r+i make it the pullback R×_{R/I}R. Milnor patching identifies K₀^cl(R→R/I) with ker(p₀*:K₀(R⋉I)→K₀(R)); the second projection recovers the triple’s difference map. Prove compatibility with automorphism boundaries and ideal maps.

For I is two-sided. Use the split projective groups, the two specified projections and their common diagonal section.

(Weibel, E II.2.3(c), p.78;IV.1.15, p.274;§II.2.10, p.77.)

*Needs:* §8.7; §8.6.

### 8.9 Degree-zero ideal excision

If a unital f:R→S identifies I with a two-sided ideal J⊂S, prove RelK₀(R,I)≃RelK₀(S,J). Use the augmented-ring kernel model and the split Milnor square to construct inverse patching maps. Naturality gives independence of the chosen ambient ring. This argument uses only relative components and the low-degree patching sequence, without a relative K₁ comparison.

f|I is bijective onto J. The result is an isomorphism in degree zero, with no implied higher excision.

(Weibel, E II.2.3(a), p.78;split augmentation and projective patching as above.)

*Needs:* §8.8; §8.6; §8.3.

### 8.10 Excision holds under hypotheses, and fails without them

Define absolute excision in degree n by requiring K_n(ℤ⋉I,I)→K_n(R,I) to be an isomorphism for every embedding of I as a two-sided ideal in a unital ring R. Degree zero always satisfies excision. For n≥1, the criterion is Tor_i^{ℤ⋉I}(ℤ,ℤ)=0 for 1≤i≤n. Tor₁=I/I², so degree-one absolute excision is equivalent to I=I². Call the all-degree condition Tor-unitality. The integral criterion is Suslin’s; the rational comparison and the plus model for the relative space have their separate Suslin–Wodzicki hypotheses. A bar-homology formulation over a base ring requires its own flatness comparison and is not silently substituted for the integral Tor criterion.

I is associative nonunital and n>0. Tor uses augmentation modules and the assertion ranges over every unital ambient ring.

(Weibel IV, Absolute Excision 1.11.2, p.IV.9.)

**Checks.**

- For I=0, all positive Tor groups vanish and excision holds.
- For a unital I, ℤ⋉I≅ℤ×I; ℤ is a direct summand and all positive Tor groups vanish.
- For a nonzero square-zero I, I/I²=I≠0, so degree-one absolute excision fails.

*Needs:* §8.3; §8.1.

### 8.11 The degree-one index

For a Serre subcategory B⊂A, let α:X→X be a morphism whose image is invertible in A/B. Compute the localization boundary of its automorphism class as [coker α]−[ker α] ∈ K₀(B). In the finitely generated module category of a noetherian ring and a central element s, this yields [R/sR]−[ann_R(s)] in the torsion Grothendieck group. This is the G-theory boundary; identifying it with the projective K-theory boundary requires the resolution comparison. The formula still has its kernel term when s is a zero divisor.

The quotient automorphism supplies the K₁ class. Its kernel/cokernel belong to B; use coker−ker. Noetherianness ensures finite-generation of the ring-example kernel.

(Weibel V, E 5.1 and Example 6.1.2, p.V.38;Weibel IV, E 7.9, p.IV.65.)

**Checks.**

- Over a DVR, multiplication by π has kernel zero and cokernel k, giving +[k].
- For a unit, both kernel and cokernel are zero and the boundary vanishes.
- For multiplication by ε on k[ε]/(ε²), kernel and cokernel are both k; their difference is zero. Dropping the kernel term gives a false answer.

*Needs:* §4.14; §2.4.

### 8.12 The DVR boundary is the normalized valuation

For a DVR O with fraction field F, residue field k and uniformizer π, identify the boundary K₁(F)=F×→K₀(k)=ℤ with the normalized valuation. The class of π maps to [k]=1 by cokernel-minus-kernel; a unit maps to zero, and multiplicativity then gives ∂(π^m u)=m for every integer m. This fixes the degree-one sign for all subsequent Laurent and tame-boundary comparisons.

Use the finite-length torsion Serre subcategory and dévissage. Normalize v(π)=1, and transport projective K-theory by the DVR resolution equivalence.

(Weibel V, Example 6.1.2,p.V.38;Dedekind sequence 6.6,p.V.41.)

*Needs:* §8.11; §4.8; §4.6.

### 8.13 Transport the right product action through the localization boundary

For a biexact pairing A×C→A′ taking B×C into B′, compare the localization fibres and show ∂(x·y)=∂x·y for x∈K_i(A/B), y∈K_j(C). For the left pairing the sphere suspension gives ∂(y·x)=(−1)^j y·∂x. Thus a uniformizer-last normalization in degree n is δ_n=(−1)^{n−1}∂_n. This is a module boundary identity, not a derivation identity for products of two arbitrary quotient classes.

i≥1 and j≥0; the uniformizer-last formula has n≥1. B⊂A and B′⊂A′ are Serre subcategories; the pairing preserves them and is exact in each variable. The right-module suspension convention is fixed by ∂[π]=+[k].

(Weibel V, E 5.3, p.V.38;§6.6.1, pp.V.41–42;Weibel IV, E 1.23, p.IV.17.)

**Checks.**

- For uniformizer-last signs, δ₁=∂₁, δ₂=−∂₂ and δ₃=∂₃.
- For j=1, the left-product boundary is −y·∂x, while the right-product boundary is ∂x·y.
- For j=0 both module-boundary formulas have sign +1.

*Needs:* §4.14; §7.2; Layer 1; §8.12.

### Examples

The relative fibre of id_R is contractible; the fibre of R→0 is K(R). Multiplication by a DVR uniformizer has index +[k]. Multiplication by ε on k[ε]/ε² has both kernel and cokernel k, so its G-theory index is zero.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–4 and 7; ring pullbacks, unitization and the supplied exact K₀.

## Layer 9: The ring projective line and Nil terms

### 9.1 The projective line over an associative ring, as a gluing category

For unital associative R, define the abelian gluing category by triples (M₊,M₋,α), with right modules over R[t] and R[t⁻¹] and an isomorphism α:M₊⊗R[t,t⁻¹]≅M₋⊗R[t,t⁻¹]. A morphism is a pair of module maps commuting with α; kernels and cokernels are componentwise, since localization at the central variable is exact. The full subcategory VB has finite-projective components and the induced exact structure. Define F(n) by replacing α with t^{−n}α. Define X₀=(1,t⁻¹) and X₁=(t,1) as maps F(n−1)→F(n). Put u_i(P)=(P[t],P[t⁻¹],t^i), so u_i(P)(n)=u_{i−n}(P). Define H⁰F and H¹F as kernel and cokernel of (x,y)↦α(x)−y on the two chart modules. These are ring gluing objects; scheme interpretation is a downstream comparison for commutative R.

Use right modules via Rᵒᵖ and opposite K-comparison; R may be noncommutative. VB is extension closed and essentially small, with gluing as object data.

(Weibel, V.1.5 and proof of V.1.5.4, pp.370–371.)

Use:

- `ProjectiveLine.Module`: Glued module triples and gluing-compatible maps.
- `ProjectiveLine.VectorBundle`: The full exact subcategory with finite-projective charts.
- `ProjectiveLine.KSpace`: K of the essentially small bundle category.
- `ProjectiveLine.twist`: F(n)=(M₊,M₋,t⁻ⁿα); X₀=(1,t⁻¹), X₁=(t,1):F(n−1)→F(n).
- `ProjectiveLine.u`: P↦(P[t],P[t⁻¹],tⁱ).
- `ProjectiveLine.u_twist`: Natural u_i(P)(n)≅u_{i−n}(P).
- `ProjectiveLine.koszul`: Exact 0→F(−2)→F(−1)²→F→0.
- `ProjectiveLine.directImage`: H⁰=ker(d), H¹=coker(d), d(x,y)=α(x)−y.
- `ProjectiveLine.map`: Exact unital bundle base change, compatible with u_i, twists, identity and composition.

**Checks.**

- π_*(u_0(R)) ≅ R and R¹π_*(u_0(R)) = 0.
- π_*(u_1(R)) = 0 and R¹π_*(u_1(R)) = 0, so, if R is nonzero, u_1(R) is not isomorphic to u_0(R) although both have components R[t] and R[t⁻¹]; a definition that forgot the gluing would identify them.
- R¹π_*(u_2(R)) ≅ R and π_*(u_2(R)) = 0.
- For R = 0 the category VB(P¹_0) is zero, so K(P¹_0) is contractible.
- u_i(P)(n) ≅ u_{i−n}(P) for all integers i and n, naturally in P.

*Needs:* §3.2; §3.1; §2.5; `ModuleCat`; `Polynomial`; `LaurentPolynomial`.

### 9.2 The two-chart Koszul sequence

For every gluing module F and integer n, prove 0→F(n−2)→F(n−1)²→F(n)→0 is exact, using (X₁,−X₀) and (X₀,X₁). On the plus chart these are (t,−1) and (1,t); their composite is zero and the second map is split onto. On the minus chart use the analogous central t⁻¹ calculation. For vector bundles the sequence is a VB-conflation, natural in F.

Use the central-variable right-module convention of §9.1 for arbitrary unital associative R. No commutative scheme result is needed.

(Quillen, §8.3, p.135/PDF59, displayed sequence after T 3.1.)

*Needs:* §9.1.

### 9.3 Eventual regularity and projectivity of sections

For a vector bundle F, find n₀ such that, for every n≥n₀ and every left R-module N, H¹(F(n)⊗_R N)=0 and H⁰(F(n))⊗_R N→H⁰(F(n)⊗_R N) is an isomorphism. Prove H⁰(F(n)) is finite projective as a right R-module. Bound the finitely many powers appearing in the gluing matrix and its inverse, and use split polynomial projectives and the resulting universal cohomology calculation.

For F has finite-projective charts. The bound depends on F, while the cohomology statement is uniform in N.

(Quillen, §8.1 L 1.1(d), p.130/PDF54;L 1.12;proof, p.133/PDF57;§8.3 p.135/PDF59.)

*Needs:* §9.1.

### 9.4 Regularity and global generation on the two charts

Call F regular when H¹(F(−1))=0. Prove H¹(F(k))=0 for every k≥−1, and that evaluation u₀(H⁰F)→F is onto. On conflations of regular vector bundles, H⁰ is exact. For regular VB-objects, H⁰(F(k)) is finite projective for all k≥−1. Use the Koszul sequence, the two-chart cohomology exact sequence and the finite-projective criterion; regularity does not mean regularity of the ring.

Use the gluing category of §9.1 over arbitrary unital associative R. The evaluation and cohomology maps use the twist convention.

(Quillen, §8.1 L 1.2,1.3,1.7, p.131/PDF55;L 1.13 p.133/PDF57;§8.3 p.135/PDF59.)

*Needs:* §9.2; §9.3.

### 9.5 The canonical resolution of a regular gluing bundle

On regular vector bundles MR, define T₀F=H⁰F and Z₀F=ker(u₀(T₀F)→F), then T₁F=H⁰(Z₀F(1)). Prove T₀,T₁:MR→P(R^op) are exact and identify the kernel evaluation with u₁(T₁F). It gives the natural VB-conflation 0→u₁(T₁F)→u₀(T₀F)→F→0. The conflation lives in VB; its first term is not claimed to be regular.

For F is regular with finite-projective charts. H⁰ and the kernel use the chart cohomology exactness of §9.4.

(Quillen, §8.1 construction1.9–1.11, p.132/PDF56;L 1.14 p.134/PDF58;§8.3 p.135/PDF59.)

Use:

- `P1.T0`: H⁰ on MR, as a finite projective right module.
- `P1.Z0`: kernel of evaluation.
- `P1.T1`: H⁰(Z₀(1)), as a finite projective right module.
- `P1.canonicalResolution`: specified three-term conflation in VB.
- `P1.canonicalResolution_natural`: Bundle morphisms induce commuting maps of the resolution.
- `P1.T0_T1_exact`: Both coefficient functors preserve conflations of MR.

**Checks.**

- For F=u₀(P), T₀=P and T₁=0.
- For F=u₋₁(P)=O(1)⊗P, T₀=P² and T₁=P, giving 0→O(−1)⊗P→O²⊗P→O(1)⊗P→0.
- For nonzero P, u₁(P) is not regular because H¹(u₁(P)(−1))=H¹(O(−2)⊗P)=P; placing the first term in MR is false.

*Needs:* §9.4.

### 9.6 Regular bundle filtration

Let MR(n) contain F with F(−n) regular. Prove MR(n)→MR(n−1) induces a K-equivalence, by the canonical-resolution comma argument and twist. Eventual regularity expresses VB as the filtered union of these subcategories as n decreases, so MR→VB is a K-equivalence. The direction of the filtration follows from regularity persisting after positive twists.

For the exact structures are induced from VB. Use finite-data continuity and §9.2–9.5.

(Quillen, §8.2 L 2.2;proof, p.134/PDF58;§8.3 p.135/PDF59.)

*Needs:* §9.4; §4.3; §2.6.

### 9.7 The K-theory of the projective line over a ring: K(R) × K(R) ≃ K(P¹_R)

Prove (u₀,u₁):K(R)×K(R)→K(VB(P¹_R)) is a homotopy equivalence in the connective theory. On MR use the canonical resolution to express the identity as u₀T₀−u₁T₁, then transport through the regular filtration and verify the inverse on u₀ and u₁. The Koszul sequence gives 2(u_{i+1})_*=(u_i)_*+(u_{i+2})_* for every integer i. Equivalently (u₀,u₀−u₁) is an equivalence; keep this basis for the localization argument.

This is the ring gluing theorem in connective degrees; the general projective-bundle theorem for schemes belongs to its scheme owner.

(Weibel, T V.1.5, pp.369–371, including V.1.5.2 and V.1.5.4;E V.1.3, p.375;Quillen, §8.3 T 3.1, p.135.)

*Needs:* §9.1; §4.3; §2.6; §3.2; §9.2; §9.5; §9.6.

### 9.8 The Nil category of a ring and the Nil groups

Define NilCat(R) on pairs (P,ν) with P finite projective and ν nilpotent; morphisms commute with ν and conflations are exact on the underlying projectives. The forgetful exact functor is split by P↦(P,0). Define the reduced Nil spectrum as its connective K-fibre and Nil_n as its homotopy groups, n≥0. Prove K(NilCat R)≃K(R)×Nil(R) and the analogous direct-sum decomposition of groups. Identify NilCat with the t-power-torsion modules of projective-resolution length at most one through P_ν. Its characteristic resolution is 0→P[t] --(t−ν)→ P[t]→P_ν→0.

ν is nilpotent; use right modules consistently and the induced exact structure on the torsion-model equivalence.

(Weibel, II.7.4.4, p.133;IV.6.7, p.324;II.7.8.2;its proof, p.138;III.3.8.1, p.207.)

Use:

- `NilCat`: Nil(R), with its exact structure.
- `NilCat.forget`: exact forgetful functor (P, ν) ↦ P.
- `NilCat.zero`: P↦(P,0), the exact forgetful section.
- `nilGroup`: π_n fib(K(Nil(R))→K(R)), n≥0.
- `KGroup.nilCat_decomposition`: K_n Nil(R) ≅ K_n(R) ⊕ Nil_n(R), naturally in R.
- `NilCat.equivTorsion`: Nil(R) ≃ H_{1,T}(R[t]), (P, ν) ↦ P_ν.
- `nilGroup_map`: Base change along unital ring maps.

**Checks.**

- For a field k, Nil₀(k)=0: the nilpotent filtration gives dévissage to k-spaces.
- For A=k[ε]/(ε²), the unit 1+εt has inverse 1−εt and evaluation 1 at t=0. Its nonidentity determinant gives a nonzero NK₁(A) class, and therefore a nonzero Nil₀(A) under §9.15.
- The zero section splits the forgetful map; (P,0) has zero reduced Nil class.
- The endomorphism 2:ℤ→ℤ is not nilpotent, since 2ⁿ≠0 for every n. It is excluded from NilCat.

*Needs:* §2.5; §3.2; `IsNilpotent`; `Polynomial`.

### 9.9 The resolution diagram for chart localization

Let H₁ be the gluing modules admitting a length-one VB-resolution, and H₁,t the full subcategory with zero minus chart. Let P be the split exact category of minus-chart projectives extending from VB. Form F=QVB×_{QP}ExtQ(P). Define G on conflations K↣V↠M⊕Q, with K,V,Q∈VB and M∈H₁,t, and Q-type morphisms preserving these data. The maps h:G→QH₁,t and f:G→F take respectively the M-term and the minus-chart conflation. Core(VB) acts by adding a bundle to K and V; both maps are equivariant. These models compare the chart fibre without relying on scheme localization.

Use the arbitrary-ring gluing category and the induced exact structures. F uses the Q-extension category of §3.6, not the ordinary category of conflations.

(Weibel V, V.7.2–7.3, pp.52–53/PDF52–53;V.7.8 pp.57–58/PDF57–58;E V.7.5 p.59/PDF59.)

Use:

- `P1.localisationModels`: equivariant diagram QH₁,t←G→F over QVB→QP.
- `P1.localisationModels_h`: h sends a resolution to its torsion quotient M.
- `P1.localisationModels_f`: f remembers Q and the split extension with quotient j*Q.
- `P1.localisationModels_action`: isoVB adds to kernel and middle object, equivariantly.
- `P1.torsionChartEquiv`: H₁,t≃H₁,T(R[t]), retaining the exact structures.

**Checks.**

- For M=0 the resolution V=K with Q=0 is an object of G.
- Taking K=0,V=Q and M=0 sends h to zero and f to the split minus-chart extension.
- A gluing module with nonzero minus chart does not belong to H₁,t, even if its plus chart is t-torsion.

*Needs:* §9.1; §9.8; §4.6; §3.8.

### 9.10 Contractibility of the resolution fibres

For M∈H₁,t, contract the category of VB-deflations V↠M and admissible inflation comparisons over M by common resolution refinements. Segal subdivision identifies this category with the homotopy-fibre model for h. Deduce that h, and its localization by Core(VB), induce realization equivalences.

M has a length-one bundle resolution. Use G from §9.9 and compatible subdivision quotient choices.

(Weibel V, V.7.3.1, pp.53–54/PDF53–54;V.7.8 pp.57–58.)

*Needs:* §9.9; Layer 1.

### 9.11 Directed bundle lattices

For a split minus-chart extension A₋↣V₋↠Q₋ and a chosen extending bundle Q, show its compatible vector-bundle lattices inside the chart extension are nonempty and directed. Bound denominators and enlarge finitely many lattices to a common one; compatibility with the fixed quotient is retained in this enlargement. The contractible poset supplies the fibre-comma comparison for f.

The target bundle Q and its gluing data are fixed; arbitrary choices of polynomial submodules would not satisfy the quotient condition.

(Weibel V, V.7.3.2 p.54/PDF54;L 7.8.1;proof of7.6.1 pp.57–58/PDF57–58.)

*Needs:* §9.9; Layer 1.

### 9.12 Projective-line localization

Prove localized h and f of §9.9 are realization equivalences, using resolution fibres and directed lattices. Track the fibre map into QVB through the canonical H₁,t→H₁ inclusion and the resolution equivalence. The diagram initially gives its additive inverse; invert on the fibre to orient the sequence as the canonical inclusion. Obtain K(H₁,t)→K(VB)→K(P) as a homotopy-fibre sequence with that chosen nullhomotopy.

All models use the same right-module gluing and exact structures. The sign adjustment is checked on the two-term characteristic resolution of §9.8.

(Weibel V, V.7.2.1 pp.52–53, L 7.3.1–7.4 pp.53–55, V.7.8 pp.57–58, E 7.5 p.59 (same PDF pages).)

*Needs:* §9.10; §9.11; §3.10; §4.3; §6.18; Layer 1.

### 9.13 Localisation at t: the sequences through R[t] and through P¹_R

For T={t^r} in R[t], prove K(H₁,T(R[t]))→K(R[t])→K(R[t,t⁻¹]) is a homotopy-fibre sequence, where H₁,T has finite-projective resolution length at most one. Identify H₁,T with H₁,t by M↦(M,0,0), and obtain K(H₁,T)→K(VB(P¹_R))→K(R[t⁻¹]) from the chart comparison. Restricting to the plus chart gives a map between these sequences that is the identity on the fibre. Through the Nil equivalence this fibre is K(R)×Nil(R). The final K₀ map in the first sequence need not be surjective.

t is central and a nonzerodivisor in R[t]. H₁,T resolves all T-torsion modules with finite finite-projective resolutions. Central zero divisors require a perfect-support model.

(Weibel, V.7.1 and the paragraph after it, pp.420–421;V.7.1.1 (Caveat 7.1.1), p.421;E V.3.14, p.399;II.7.7.3, p.137;E V.3.13, p.399;E V.7.5, p.429;E V.7.5(b)–(c), p.429.)

*Needs:* §9.1; §9.8; §6.8; §6.3; §4.6; §3.2; §9.12.

### 9.14 The Nil inclusion factors through the forgetful map on K-theory

Compute the map from NilCat(R) into H₁(P¹_R), (P,ν)↦(P_ν,0,0), after the VB-resolution comparison. Its characteristic resolution gives K(I)≃(u₀−u₁)∘K(forget). Hence its restriction to the reduced Nil fibre is nullhomotopic. Prove compatibility of this calculation with the sign-adjusted chart-fibre comparison.

ν is nilpotent and the module conventions are those of §9.1 and §9.8. The computation is of maps of K-spaces, and not only their K₀ values.

(Weibel, Proof of T V.8.1, book p.430 (full PDF p.438;chapter V PDF pp.60–61),;the characteristic resolution of L II.7.8.2.)

*Needs:* §9.1; §9.8; §9.13; §4.3.

### 9.15 Nil_n(R) ≅ NK_{n+1}(R)

For n≥0, identify Nil_n(R) naturally with NK_{n+1}(R)=coker(K_{n+1}(R)→K_{n+1}(R[t])). Split the chart localization sequence by the projective-line equivalence and the forgetful calculation: the K_n(R) summand enters by u₀−u₁ while the reduced Nil summand enters by zero. The residual quotient gives the stated isomorphism. Evaluation at zero splits the polynomial injection, so its cokernel also identifies with the evaluation kernel.

R is unital associative, and the Nil index is nonnegative. Changing t to t⁻¹ gives the second polynomial-chart version. No negative-index NilCat homotopy group is defined here.

(Weibel, T V.8.1 and proof, p.430;III.3.5.3, p.205.)

*Needs:* §9.13; §9.7; §9.8; §4.3; §3.2; §9.14.

### 9.16 The positive Fundamental Theorem

For n≥1, prove 0→K_n(R)→K_n(R[t])⊕K_n(R[t⁻¹])→K_n(R[t,t⁻¹])→K_{n−1}(R)→0 is exact. The first map is diagonal scalar extension, the second is the difference of the chart maps, and the boundary is t-localization followed by the forgetful retraction from K_{n−1}NilCat(R). Combine the two chart sequences and the projective-line basis (u₀,u₀−u₁). Evaluation at t=1 splits the constant terms; multiplication by [t] supplies the boundary splitting in §9.17.

Use the finite-resolution transfer of 0→R[t] --t→R[t]→R→0. Layer 10 proves degree zero.

(Weibel, T V.8.2 and proof, pp.430–431;V.3.5.1, p.388.)

*Needs:* §9.13; §9.15; §9.7; §7.7; §4.3; §3.2.

### 9.17 The t-class section

For x∈K_n(R), n≥0, use the external pairing with [t]∈K₁(ℤ[t,t⁻¹]) in the first factor to define {t,x}∈K_{n+1}(R[t,t⁻¹]). Prove torsion-category boundary is (x,0)∈K_n(R)⊕Nil_n(R), by the product-boundary formula and the characteristic resolution for the zero endomorphism. Thus ∂{t,x}=x after forgetting the Nil coordinate, and this is the natural right inverse in the Fundamental Theorem. The sign is fixed by ∂[t]=+[R[t]/t].

R need not be commutative: tensoring over ℤ gives the external biexact pairing. Keep [t] first; moving it to the second factor changes the sign according to the degree of x.

(Weibel, V.8.2, proof, the splitting, p.431;E V.8.1, p.434;E IV.1.23, p.276.)

*Needs:* §7.4; §9.13; §9.8; §9.16; §3.1–3.5, §8.4; §3.12; Layer 1.

### Examples

The line objects u₀,u₁,u₂ have (H⁰,H¹) equal to (R,0), (0,0), (0,R). This fixes twist direction and rules out forgetting the gluing. The unit 1+εt detects a nonzero Nil₀ class over dual numbers. In Laurent splitting, {t,x} maps to x.

### Dependencies

Layers 1–8; central polynomial localization, module kernels/cokernels and nilpotent endomorphisms.

## Layer 10: Bass contraction and the nonconnective ring spectrum

### 10.1 Flasque rings, infinite sum rings and the Eilenberg swindle

For an associative unital R, define flasque-ring data as an (R,R)-bimodule M, finite projective on the right, with a bimodule isomorphism R⊕M≅M. Tensoring right finite projectives with M gives an exact endofunctor T and a natural isomorphism id⊕T≅T. Additivity makes K(id) nullhomotopic, so connective K(R) is contractible. The same swindle applies to the polynomial and Laurent extensions and hence all Bass negative groups vanish. Define C(R) using countable row-and-column-finite matrices; its finite-support ideal is M∞R and S(R)=C(R)/M∞R. Show the shift decompositions give C(R) the stated swindle data.

Rows and columns are finite without uniform bounds on entries. Finite-support matrices form a two-sided ideal; use right-module tensor orientations.

(Weibel, II.2.1.3, p.69;E I.1.8 (Cone Ring), p.5.)

Use:

- `IsFlasqueRing`: bimodule and the isomorphism witnessing flasqueness.
- `IsFlasqueRing.K0_eq_zero`: zeroth K-group of a flasque ring vanishes.
- `IsInfiniteSumRing`: flasque ring whose bimodule is the ring as a right module.
- `coneRing`: cone ring of a ring, the row-and-column finite infinite matrices.
- `coneRing_isInfiniteSumRing`: cone ring is an infinite sum ring, hence flasque.

**Checks.**

- The row-and-column-finite cone ring ΓR is flasque by disjoint infinite block embeddings; finite-support matrices form its two-sided ideal M∞R.
- For a nonzero field k, k is not flasque: [k] is 1 in K₀(k)=ℤ and a swindle would force it to zero.
- For the zero ring, the zero bimodule witnesses flasqueness. The swindle gives K₀=0.
- For a flasque bimodule M with M⊕R≅M, tensoring a finite projective P gives P⊗_R M⊕P≅P⊗_R M, hence [P]=0.

*Needs:* `Matrix`; `RingHom`.

### 10.2 Contracted functors and the contraction LF

For F from unital rings to abelian groups, define NF(R)=coker(F(R)→F(R[t])) and LF(R)=coker(F(R[t])⊕F(R[t⁻¹])→F(R[t,t⁻¹])), with difference of chart maps. Evaluation splits the map defining N. Call F acyclic if 0→F(R)→F(R[t])⊕F(R[t⁻¹])→F(R[t,t⁻¹])→LF(R)→0 is exact. Contracted data consist of acyclicity and a natural section of the final map, compatible with change of ring and relabeling of the polynomial variable. Establish formal N/L interchange and the induced contraction data on LF and NF.

R is associative unital and the polynomial variable is central. The diagonal, difference and cokernel maps are part of the data, as is naturality of the section.

(Weibel, III.4.1.1, p.210.)

Use:

- `contraction`: functor LF.
- `IsAcyclic`: acyclicity predicate.
- `IsContracted`: Acyclicity together with the natural splitting.
- `IsContracted.splitting`: splitting, natural in the ring and the variable.
- `contraction_iterate`: iterates NLF and L-squared F.
- `IsContracted.sum`: direct sum of contracted functors is contracted.

**Checks.**

- For the constant functor F(R)=ℤ with all maps the identity, the diagonal/difference sequence is exact, NF=LF=0.
- The diagonal sends 1 to (1,1) and the chart difference sends (a,b) to a−b; replacing the difference by sum makes their composite 2 at a=b=1.
- For F=K₀ and a field k, NK₀(k)=LK₀(k)=0; the Laurent sequence reduces to ℤ→ℤ²→ℤ with diagonal and difference.
- Evaluation at t=0 identifies NF with the kernel of evaluation, so an element coming from F(R) has zero N-class.

*Needs:* §10.1; `Polynomial`; `LaurentPolynomial`.

### 10.3 Bass's negative K-groups

Define Bass K_{−n}(R)=LⁿK₀(R) for n≥0, using the projective K₀ functor. Construct its functorial maps by the cokernel universal property. For a nonunital I, first put K₀(I)=ker(K₀(ℤ⋉I)→K₀(ℤ)), and then apply the same central-variable contractions to nonunital polynomial and Laurent rings. The split augmentation makes this agree with the reduced contraction of unitization. This early group-level extension supplies the ideal and corner maps needed in the negative axioms. The later spectrum fibre comparison proves agreement with this definition.

Keep signed iteration indices; K₀ remains the supplied degree-zero group.

(Weibel, III.4.1, p.210;III.3.7, p.206;III.4.1.1, following paragraph, p.210.)

Use:

- `negativeK`: n-th negative K-group.
- `negativeK_functor`: Functoriality in the ring.
- `negativeK_one`: first negative group is the contraction of the zeroth K-group.
- `negativeK_eq_contraction_iterate`: K_{−n}=LⁿK₀.
- `negativeK_flasque`: negative groups of a flasque ring vanish.
- `negativeK_prod`: Compatibility with finite products of rings.

**Checks.**

- At iteration zero, negativeK(R,0) is K₀(R); for a field k its generator [k] is 1 in ℤ.
- For every field k, negativeK(k,1)=0; a copy of K₀(k) in degree −1 would fail.
- For a flasque R every iteration vanishes, including zero.
- For k×k, iteration zero gives ℤ² and each positive iteration is zero; products are finite.

*Needs:* §10.2; §3.2; `LaurentPolynomial`; `ExactK0`.

### 10.4 Contraction of negative groups

Prove K₀ is contracted and LK₁≅K₀. Obtain the degree-zero natural section by applying the degree-one Fundamental Theorem in a second variable and passing to its cokernel. Prove N/L interchange needed for iteration. It follows inductively that every K_{−n} is contracted and LK_{−n}≅K_{−n−1}. The Laurent decomposition has four terms K_{−n}(R), K_{−n−1}(R), and the two chart NK_{−n}(R) terms.

Use the central two-variable square, its commuting specializations and the connective K₁ adapter. Sections are natural in rings and in the chosen variable.

(Weibel, T III.3.6–3.7 and proofs, pp.205–206;III.4.1.1–4.1.2, p.210;III.4.2, p.211.)

*Needs:* §10.2; §10.3; §9.16; §9.17; §3.2.

### 10.5 The Fundamental Theorem with Nil terms, in every degree

Combine the positive-degree theorem with contractedness to obtain the diagonal/difference split exact sequence in every integer degree. Thus K_j(R[t,t⁻¹])≅K_j(R)⊕K_{j−1}(R)⊕NK_j(R)⊕NK_j(R). For j≥1 the section is x↦{t,x}; for j≤0 use the contraction section, later identified with the extended spectrum product. In the overlap NK_{n+1}≅Nil_n for n≥0, use the precise reduced Nil definition of Layer 9. A two-term decomposition requires the NK terms to vanish.

NilCat homotopy is only nonnegative; no negative Nil_n is introduced by this formula. Scheme projective-bundle results are downstream.

(Weibel, V.8.2, p.430;V.8.1, p.430;V.8, opening, p.430;V.8.2, proof, p.431.)

*Needs:* §9.16; §9.17; §10.4; §9.15; §10.3; §10.2; `LaurentPolynomial`.

### 10.6 Morita invariance

Use a supplied module-category Morita equivalence and its exact finite-projective restriction to induce connective K-equivalences. Prove it commutes with the central-variable construction: polynomial modules are modules with a commuting endomorphism, so the equivalence and its inverse extend to these categories. It induces natural Bass negative-group isomorphisms. For a nonempty finite matrix index, the matrix equivalence gives K_j(M_nR)≅K_j(R). Pairing compatibility requires the stated commuting biexact diagram; internal unit preservation requires additional monoidal unit data.

Use right modules and opposite comparison. Additive Morita equivalences need not be monoidal; matrix size is positive.

(Weibel, II.2.7, p.75;II.2.7.1, p.76;II.2.7.2, p.76;IV.6.3.5, p.321.)

Use:

- `KTheory.moritaEquiv`: induced isomorphism of K-groups from a Morita equivalence.
- `KTheory.moritaEquiv_matrix`: instance for the matrix ring.
- `KTheory.moritaEquiv_mul`: External-product compatibility for Morita diagrams with a specified biexact comparison.
- `KTheory.moritaEquiv_negative`: isomorphism holds in negative degrees as well.

**Checks.**

- For n ≥ 1, K_*(M_n(R)) ≅ K_*(R); the n = 0 case over a field fails.
- For k and M₂(k), K₀ is ℤ on both sides although the rings are not isomorphic.
- For a commutative ring with an invertible module L whose class differs from [R] in K₀, the Morita autoequivalence L ⊗_R − sends [R] to [L]. Thus it is not a unital K₀-ring automorphism. A product comparison must carry additional monoidal/biexact compatibility data.
- For k and M₂(k), every negative group is zero; the matrix equivalence retains the degree rather than shifting K₀ into K₋₁.

*Needs:* `ModuleCat.matrixEquivalence`; `IsMoritaEquivalent`; `IsMoritaEquivalent.matrix`; `Matrix`; `ExactK0`; §2.5; §3.2; §10.3; §7.4.

### 10.7 The axioms a theory of negative K-theory must satisfy

Define negative-theory data on associative possibly nonunital rings: functors E_j, j≤0; E₀≅K₀; and natural ideal boundaries E_j(R/I)→E_{j−1}(I). Require exactness of E_j(I)→E_j(R)→E_j(R/I)→E_{j−1}(I)→E_{j−1}(R), vanishing on flasque rings, and invariance under the actual nonunital inclusion R→M∞R. Prove Bass groups with the early nonunital extension satisfy these axioms, using patching, contraction and the swindle. These requirements give a comparison interface, rather than assuming that all alternative negative models agree.

Ideals are two-sided. The finite corner maps and their union are nonunital and use the idempotent-extension functors introduced in Layer 3. Flasqueness includes its bimodule data.

(Weibel, III.4.4, p.213;III.4.4, axioms (3)–(4), p.213;III.4.4.1, p.214.)

Use:

- `NegativeKTheory`: functors in degrees at most zero together with the boundary maps.
- `NegativeKTheory.k0`: Axiom one: in degree zero the functor is the Grothendieck group.
- `NegativeKTheory.exact_ideal`: Axiom two: the five-term sequence of an ideal is exact.
- `NegativeKTheory.flasque`: Axiom three: a flasque ring has vanishing groups.
- `NegativeKTheory.matrix`: Axiom four: the inclusion in the infinite matrix ring is an isomorphism.
- `bassTheory`: Bass’s negative groups form such a theory.

**Checks.**

- At degree zero the comparison sends [P] to the projective class; for k the class [k] is 1.
- For I=0, the ideal exact sequence is 0→E_j(R) --id→ E_j(R)→0→0.
- For I=R, the quotient is the zero ring and E_j(I)→E_j(R) is the identity.
- For the nonunital corner k→M₂k, the image of k is the rank-one row projective and its K₀ class is 1 in the Morita normalization. The unital diagonal map instead has class 2.

*Needs:* §10.3; §10.1; `Matrix`.

### 10.8 The cone proof of uniqueness for negative ring theories

For every theory satisfying §10.7, the exact sequence M∞R→C(R)→S(R), cone vanishing and matrix invariance identify E_j(S(R))≅E_{j−1}(R), j≤0. Iterate these boundary isomorphisms from the E₀≅K₀ to construct a unique natural comparison with Bass groups. Prove it preserves ideal boundaries by the commuting cone/ideal diagrams. The word unique is relative to the fixed degree-zero identification and boundary data.

Use the row-and-column-finite cone, its finite-support ideal and the nonunital maps, not an incorrectly unital matrix union.

(Weibel, §III.4.4 and T III.4.5, pp.213–214.)

*Needs:* §10.7.

### 10.9 Mayer–Vietoris for a Milnor square, continued into negative degrees

For a Milnor pullback square with one quotient map surjective, extend the K₁–K₀ patching sequence downward in Bass degrees. Contract the polynomial-chart versions of the patching sequence and their compatible boundaries. For every j≤0 obtain exactness K_j(R)→K_j(R₁)⊕K_j(R₂)→K_j(S)→K_{j−1}(R), with the chart difference convention and its continuation. The common ideal need not be Tor-unital. No K₂ or higher Milnor excision is inferred.

The square is a pullback of associative unital rings and at least one map to S is onto. Use projective patching and the nonunital negative groups for the common two-sided ideal.

(Weibel, III.4.3, pp.212–213;III.4, the paragraph before T 4.3, p.212;III.2.6, p.195;III.4.3.1, p.213.)

*Needs:* §10.3; §10.4; §10.2; §8.6; §3.1–3.5, §8.4; §3.12; Layer 1.

### 10.10 The nonconnective Bass K-theory spectrum

For a spectrum-valued ring functor E, form P(E)(R)=E(R[t]) ⨿ʰ_{E(R)} E(R[t⁻¹]), then L(E)(R)=cofib(P(E)(R)→E(R[t,t⁻¹])) and ΛE=ΩL(E). The product with [t], in the first factor, gives K→ΛK and compatible maps Λ^rK→Λ^{r+1}K. Define Kᴮ as their sequential homotopy colimit. Use the connective Fundamental Theorem to prove that each step retains the previously established degrees and adds the next Bass degree.

Use derived spectrum pushouts/cofibres (§1.7), S-deloopings (Layer 5) and pairings (Layer 7). Connectivity bounds depend on the stage.

(Weibel, IV.10.1–10.3, p.349;IV.10.4, p.350.)

Use:

- `deloop`: functor LE and its desuspension.
- `deloop_cofibration`: natural cofibration sequence.
- `bassSpectrum`: nonconnective Bass K-theory spectrum.
- `bassSpectrum_natural`: Naturality in the ring and in the model of connective K-theory.
- `bassSpectrum_independent`: Two naturally equivalent models of connective K-theory give equivalent nonconnective spectra.

**Checks.**

- In non-negative degrees the homotopy groups are the K-groups of the connective spectrum.
- In degree minus one the homotopy group is the first negative K-group.
- For a regular noetherian ring the negative homotopy vanishes.
- Two models of connective K-theory related by a natural equivalence give equivalent nonconnective spectra.

*Needs:* §10.5; §10.3; §10.7; §7.4; §3.2; §5.11; Layer 1.

### 10.11 The homotopy groups of the Bass spectrum are the K-groups and Bass's negative groups

Prove K(R)→Kᴮ(R) is an isomorphism on π_j for j≥0, and π_{−n}Kᴮ(R)≅LⁿK₀(R) for n≥1. At the first newly exposed degree identify the cokernel in the cofiber exact sequence with the Bass contraction; use the product-induced section and then induction. Sequential homotopy-colimit continuity makes these stage comparisons isomorphisms for the final spectrum. Prove naturality and agreement of the spectrum boundaries with the contraction boundaries.

Integer indexing and the tail range of each Λ-stage are explicit; no negative homotopy group of a space is used.

(Weibel, IV.10, opening, p.349;IV.10.3, proof, p.350;IV.10.4, last sentence, p.350;V.8.4, p.432.)

*Needs:* §10.10; §10.5; §10.4; §10.3; §9.17.

### 10.12 Nonpositive Milnor excision

For a unital f:R→S identifying a two-sided ideal I with J⊂S, the map fib(Kᴮ(R)→Kᴮ(R/I))→fib(Kᴮ(S)→Kᴮ(S/J)) induces isomorphisms in every degree j≤0. At degree zero use the relative-triple patching comparison; contract it compatibly to reach negative degrees. The birelative fibre has π_j=0 for j≤−1. Its π₀ can still contain the cokernel of the relative π₁ map; no stronger connectivity claim is needed here. Applied to ℤ⋉I→R, the nonpositive relative groups depend only on I.

The square is Milnor with S→S/J onto. No Tor-unitality is needed; classical relative K₁ surjectivity requires an adapter to spectrum π₁.

(Weibel, IV.10.1, p.349;E IV.10.1, p.351;III.2.2.1 (Remark 2.2.1), p.193;Clausen–Mathew–Morrow, T 4.33, p.35;P 4.34, proof, p.35;arXiv:1803.10897v2 p35.)

*Needs:* §10.11; §10.10; §10.5; §10.4; §10.2; §10.9; §8.10; §8.1; §8.3; §8.6; Layer 1; §8.9.

### 10.13 Vanishing of the negative K-groups for a regular noetherian ring

For a left noetherian ring of finite left global dimension, prove K_{−n}(R)=0 for every n>0. Resolution identifies projective K₀ with module G₀; polynomial homotopy invariance in the degree-zero resolution argument kills the contraction terms, and iteration gives the result. The analogous right-module formulation is transported through opposite-ring duality. This supplies a sufficient regular noetherian scope without defining regularity by a claim about arbitrary infinite modules. The absence of negative homotopy in the connective spectrum is not evidence for this vanishing theorem.

Use the stated finite-global-dimension noetherian scope and Bass negative groups, or their identified nonconnective homotopy groups. No converse for singular rings is asserted.

(Weibel, III.4.1, after D 4.1, p.210;V.8, opening, p.430;I.3.7.1, p.23.)

*Needs:* §10.5; §10.10; §10.9.

### Examples

For a field all negative groups vanish. The zero ring has zero group even in iteration zero. A nonzero field cannot be flasque because its free class is 1 in ℤ. Matrix Morita invariance requires a nonempty matrix index; M₀(k) has zero K₀.

### Dependencies

Layers 1, 3 and 7–9; abelian-group cokernels and sequential derived spectrum constructions.

## Layer 11: Frobenius pairs and negative localization

### 11.1 Frobenius categories, Frobenius pairs and their derived categories

Define `FrobeniusPair` as a fully faithful exact inclusion A₀→A₁ between small Frobenius exact categories that preserves projective-injective objects. Its derived category is the Verdier quotient stable(A₁)/stable(A₀). Define maps of pairs by compatible exact functors preserving these objects, and the induced triangle functor. The new object is the pair and its quotient; its two Frobenius structures and stable triangulations are suppliers. For a small exact E, use bounded complexes with degreewise split conflations as A₁, and the complexes homotopy equivalent to admissibly acyclic complexes as A₀. Prove that this is a pair whose quotient is Dᵇ(E).

The inclusion is fully faithful and exact. Both structures have enough projectives and injectives with coincident classes; pair maps preserve these classes. Admissible acyclicity factors differentials through conflations; homotopy-acyclicity accommodates incomplete exact categories.

(Schlichting 2003, §3.3–3.5, pp.8–9;§5.3 and D 5.4, p.11.)

Use:

- `FrobeniusPair`: fully faithful exact inclusion preserving projective-injectives.
- `FrobeniusPair.derived`: Verdier quotient of the stable categories.
- `FrobeniusPair.map`: induced triangle functor for a compatible map of pairs.
- `FrobeniusPair.ofExact`: bounded-complex and homotopy-acyclic pair of an exact category.
- `FrobeniusPair.waldhausen`: Inflations and maps inverted in the derived quotient.

**Checks.**

- For the identity inclusion A→A, the derived quotient is zero.
- For 0→A with A split exact, every A-object is projective-injective and the derived quotient is zero.
- For bounded finite-dimensional k-complexes, the acyclic part contains the two-term identity complex but excludes k concentrated in degree zero.
- Enough projectives alone does not supply the `IsFrobenius` hypothesis; finitely generated ℤ-modules are a negative control.

*Needs:* `ExactStructure.IsFrobenius`; `ExactStructure.split_isFrobenius`; `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.IsTriangulated`; `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.trW`; `ExactK0`; `CategoryTheory.Idempotents.Karoubi`.

### 11.2 Existential factorization in a Frobenius pair

For a Frobenius pair, factor any map by an inflation followed by a weak equivalence, using enough injectives and a graph map into an injective summand. Construct dual deflation factorization using enough projectives. These choices prove existence and supply both orientations of the factorization-based Waldhausen apparatus; a functorial choice of projective-injectives is unnecessary.

Use the Frobenius axioms, including both enough-projective and enough-injective fields. Weak equivalences are inverted in the pair’s derived quotient.

(Schlichting 2003, Remark11.2, p.20/PDF20;Appendix A.5, p.25.)

*Needs:* §11.1; §5.12.

### 11.3 Stable classes modulo a dense triangulated subcategory

For a strictly full dense triangulated A⊂T, define X∼Y when X⊕A₁≅Y⊕A₂ for A₁,A₂∈A. Prove resulting direct-sum monoid is an abelian group: choose a complement to X in A to obtain an inverse. Triangle relations descend to this quotient, and comparison with the universal Euler presentation gives G_A≅K₀(T)/im K₀(A). Prove that the zero stable class is equivalent to membership in A.

T is essentially small; dense means that every T-object is a direct summand of an A-object. Strict fullness, closure under shifts and triangles are essential.

(Thomason, L 2.2, pp.5–6/PDF5–6.)

Use:

- `DenseClasses`: Stable direct-sum quotient of T by A.
- `DenseClasses.zero_iff`: class(X)=0 iff X∈A.
- `DenseClasses.euler`: distinguished triangle gives class(Y)=class(X)+class(Z).
- `DenseClasses.quotientEquiv`: G_A≃K₀(T)/im K₀(A).

**Checks.**

- If A=T the quotient is zero.
- For bounded complexes of finite-dimensional k-spaces, A={Euler characteristic even}; G_A≅ℤ/2 and k[0] has nonzero class.
- A nonzero A-object has zero quotient class, so ordinary object isomorphism classes are the wrong quotient.

*Needs:* §11.1; `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.IsTriangulated`.

### 11.4 The K-zero criterion for a dense triangulated subcategory

Prove X∈A exactly when [X] belongs to im(K₀A→K₀T). Conversely, for each subgroup H⊂K₀T the strictly full objects whose classes lie in H form a dense triangulated subcategory. These assignments are inverse and K₀A→K₀T is injective. Use the preceding stabilized-object quotient to realize Euler equalities, rather than inferring object membership from an arbitrary equality in a Grothendieck group.

Use the dense triangulated hypotheses of §11.3 and the Euler K₀ presentation. A non-dense triangulated subcategory need not be determined by its K₀ image.

(Thomason, T 2.1 and C 2.3, pp.5–6/PDF5–6.)

*Needs:* §11.3.

### 11.5 Flasque enlargement and suspension

Construct countable admissible-ind envelope: objects are inflation sequences X₀↣X₁↣⋯ and maps are lim_i colim_j Hom(X_i,Y_j), with induced exact structure. Establish exact countable coproducts and the natural swindle id⊕T≅T. For a Frobenius pair form its Frobenius envelope F and the suspension pair S using the full objects killed by the quotient of the envelope-derived category by the original derived category. Prove original idempotent-completed derived category identifies with the countably compact objects of the envelope, and D(S) is the Verdier quotient. Verify exactness of the natural sequence id→F→S. Define the Frobenius IK spectrum now by spectrifying levels K(SʳA). The structure map K(A)→ΩK(SA) comes from the envelope contraction and the composite nullhomotopy; the completed-level computation is §11.14.

Keep the smallness bounds. Countable compactness concerns countable coproducts only; use the exact ind-envelope.

(Schlichting 2003, L 4.2, p.9;§4.1, D 4.3, P 4.4 and D 4.7, pp.9–10;T 4.8, p.10.)

Use:

- `countableEnvelope`: countable envelope of a small exact category.
- `countableEnvelope_isFlasque`: envelope is flasque, with the shift functor as witness.
- `FrobeniusPair.enlarge`: endofunctor F of Frobenius pairs.
- `FrobeniusPair.enlarge_generates`: enlarged derived category is c-compactly generated by the original.
- `FrobeniusPair.suspension`: suspension endofunctor S.
- `FrobeniusPair.setup`: identity, F and S satisfy the three conditions of the model set-up.
- `FrobeniusPair.IK`: Spectrification of the suspension prespectrum with envelope structure maps.

**Checks.**

- For the zero exact category the countable envelope and suspension are zero.
- In the envelope of finite-dimensional k-spaces, the countable-sum functor T satisfies k⊕T(k)≅T(k); finite-dimensional k-spaces alone cannot admit that swindle.
- The enlargement has IK₀=0 by additivity of id⊕T≅T, while the original k-model has K₀=ℤ.
- The composite M→FM→SM has zero derived image; the quotient SM still retains the connecting map, rather than being identified with FM.

*Needs:* §11.1; §10.1; `CategoryTheory.Idempotents.Karoubi`.

### 11.6 The set-up: negative K-groups of a triangulated category with models

Define a model setup as a category of models with a derived triangulated-category functor, endofunctors F,S, and natural transformations id→F→S. An exact sequence of triangulated categories has zero composite, fully faithful first map, and a cofinal induced Verdier quotient map. Require F and S to preserve these sequences, K₀(D(FM)^♮)=0, and M→FM→SM to be exact. Put IK₀(M)=K₀(D(M)^♮) and IK_{−n}(M)=IK₀(SⁿM). Verify the preceding Frobenius envelopes satisfy these axioms.

Cofinal means fully faithful with every target object a summand of an image object. Idempotent completion and its triangulated structure are supplied; this target adds the K-theoretic setup.

(Schlichting 2003, D 1.1, Facts 1.2, Set-up 1.3 and D 1.4, pp.4–5;§5.5, p.11.)

Use:

- `IsExactSequence`: An exact sequence of small triangulated categories, with the cofinality condition.
- `IK0`: zeroth invariant, the K-group of the idempotent completion.
- `NegativeKSetup`: category of models with F, S and the three conditions.
- `negativeIK`: negative groups of a model.
- `negativeIK_frobenius`: instance at Frobenius pairs.
- `IK0_eq_K0_of_idempotentComplete`: IK₀=K₀ for idempotent-complete exact categories.

**Checks.**

- For the exact category of finite-dimensional k-spaces, IK₀ is ℤ with [k]=1, since it is idempotent complete.
- For the zero model all suspension iterates have zero group.
- For the identity sequence T --id→ T→0, exactness gives the expected identity and zero maps.
- The inclusion of the even-Euler-characteristic subcategory of Dᵇ(k) is cofinal but not essentially surjective: k[0] is a summand of k[0]⊕k[0] but is not itself an even-Euler object.

*Needs:* §11.5; `CategoryTheory.Idempotents.Karoubi`; §11.4.

### 11.7 Negative localization

For an exact sequence of setup models, construct the boundary by lifting a class through the flasque enlargement, and prove independence of the lift. Obtain the exact nonpositive sequence through IK₀ and all negative groups. A cofinal derived functor induces isomorphisms on these groups. Relate vanishing of IK₋₁(M) to idempotent completeness of the quotient between idempotent-completed derived categories in every exact sequence beginning at M, using the object-lifting obstruction in the first boundary.

The Verdier quotient comparison need only be cofinal. Localization applies to exact model sequences, not arbitrary triangulated functors.

(Schlichting 2003, L 1.6, T 1.7, C 1.8 and Remark 1.9, pp.5–6;§5.5, p.11.)

*Needs:* §11.6; §11.5.

### 11.8 Additivity and filtered colimits for the negative groups

For a conflation F₀↣F₁↠F₂ of model maps, prove (F₁)_*=(F₀)_*+(F₂)_* on every IK_j, j≤0. The componentwise inflation and its quotient must again be model maps. Prove filtered continuity in these degrees: compare the colimit of the flasque envelopes with an envelope of the colimit and use the swindle and localization to identify the groups. Apply this to exact-category models with compatible induced structures.

The indexing category is small filtered. A mere natural transformation has no additivity conclusion without the conflation hypotheses.

(Schlichting 2003, T 6.1, C 6.2, L 6.3 and C 6.4, pp.13–14.)

*Needs:* §11.7.

### 11.9 The weak inflation replacement of an exact functor

For an exact map F of Frobenius pairs inducing a derived equivalence, form the category of triples (a,b,i:F(a)↣b). A conflation is detected on a, b and coker i. Restrict to weak inflations i to obtain the replacement C, with the C₀. Prove it is a Frobenius pair. The section a↦(a,F(a),id) and the a-projection induce inverse connective K-equivalences, by additivity applied to the triple and its weak quotient.

F preserves projective-injectives and both subpairs. The weak-inflation restriction is part of the model; the full inflation category alone is not this replacement.

(Schlichting 2003, P 11.15 proof, pp.22–23/PDF22–23.)

Use:

- `FrobeniusReplacement`: Objects (a,i:F(a)↣b) with i weak.
- `FrobeniusReplacement.exactStructure`: Conflations on a,b,coker(i).
- `FrobeniusReplacement.toSource`: Projection to a.
- `FrobeniusReplacement.toTarget`: Projection to b.
- `FrobeniusReplacement.sourceKEquiv`: source embedding and retraction induce inverse K-equivalences.

**Checks.**

- For F=id, a↦(a,id) retracts onto a.
- (0,0↣I) is allowed for projective-injective I and is weakly zero.
- For F=id on bounded complexes over k, 0↣k[0] has nonzero derived cokernel and is excluded.

*Needs:* §11.1; §11.2; §4.1; Layer 1.

### 11.10 Strictify the roof diagram for dual approximation

Prove replacement projection C→B reflects weak equivalences and satisfies dual approximation. For c=(a,b,i) and a map b′→b, represent its derived lift using the equivalence of derived categories, replace its roof by an admissible deflation, and pull back to obtain c₃↠c with a weak map b′→pr_B(c₃) over b. Check exactness and the weak condition after the pullback. The construction supplies the actual diagram required by App2, beyond fullness in the Verdier quotient.

Use the exact pair map of §11.9 and factorization in both orientations; an abstract triangulated equivalence does not supply these data.

(Schlichting 2003, P 11.15, diagram11.16 and the pullback proof, p.23/PDF23;Thomason–Trobaugh, 1.9.8.3–1.9.8.4, pp.272–274/PDF14–15.)

*Needs:* §11.9; §11.2; Layer 1.

### 11.11 Derived invariance through the replacement and approximation

Apply factorization-based approximation to the target projection of the replacement, in the opposite category when using the dual form. Combine it with the source projection equivalence to prove K(A)≃K(B) for a pair map with derived equivalence. Envelope functoriality and countably compact generation preserve that hypothesis after each suspension, giving a stable equivalence IK(A)≃IK(B).

F is an exact pair map preserving projective-injectives and inducing a derived equivalence.

(Schlichting 2003, P 11.15, pp.22–23;T 4.8, p.10.)

*Needs:* §11.10; §6.12; §11.5.

### 11.12 Cofinality of Frobenius models

For an exact pair map inducing a fully faithful cofinal derived functor, identify its source with the target objects whose K₀ classes lie in the source image, using dense triangulated classification. Apply factorization cofinality to prove an isomorphism on π_jK for j≥1 and an injection on π₀K. The missing π₀ classes form the explicitly retained quotient; completing idempotents is not claimed to preserve connective K₀.

Cofinality is summand density and full faithfulness in the derived quotient. Use §11.4 and the factorization cofinality targets of Layer 6.

(Schlichting 2003, P 11.17, pp.23–24;Facts1.2, p.4;Appendix A.4, p.25.)

*Needs:* §11.11; §11.4; §6.17.

### 11.13 Fibration for nested Frobenius weak classes

For D₀⊂D₁ thick triangulated subcategories of the stable category of B, let B_i be their inverse-image exact subcategories. The two nested weak-equivalence classes give K(B₁,B₀)→K(B,B₀)→K(B,B₁) as a homotopy-fibre sequence. Check extension, saturation and acyclic factorization through the stable triangulated conditions, then apply the factorization fibration theorem with its chosen nullhomotopy.

The D_i contain zero and are closed under summands as well as triangles. B and B_i satisfy the Frobenius-pair conditions.

(Schlichting 2003, P 11.18, p.24/PDF24;Appendix A.3, p.25.)

*Needs:* §11.2; §6.14.

### 11.14 The completion comparison and the homotopy groups of IK

Inside the envelope FA retain objects killed in D(SA), producing a completion pair Â. Prove D(Â)≃D(A)^♮ by countably compact generation. The nested weak fibration and envelope swindle give K(Â)≃ΩK(SA). These completed levels form an Ω-spectrum stably equivalent to the uncompleted suspension prespectrum. Compute π_jIK(A)=π_jK(A) for j>0, π₀IK(A)=K₀(D(A)^♮), and π_{−n}IK(A)=K₀(D(SⁿA)^♮) for n≥1.

The stable comparison is a spectrum comparison; the degree-zero completion can change K₀. Use §11.5, §11.12 and §11.13.

(Schlichting 2003, T 11.7 proof, pp.21–22/PDF21–22.)

*Needs:* §11.12; §11.13; §11.5.

### 11.15 Localization of the Frobenius IK spectra in all degrees

An exact sequence of Frobenius pairs induces a homotopy-fibre sequence of their IK spectra. Apply the nested weak fibration at the completed envelope levels, and use model cofinality to compare the actual third pair with the quotient model. On the Ω-spectrum levels this identifies the fibre, including its specified nullhomotopy. Deduce the integer-graded localization sequence with the completion-corrected degree-zero term.

Exactness means fully faithful derived first map and cofinal Verdier quotient map. All pair maps preserve projective-injectives. Saturation is inherited from derived isomorphisms.

(Schlichting 2003, T 11.10 proof, p.22/PDF22, and saturation qualification.)

*Needs:* §11.14; §11.13; §11.12; Layer 1.

### 11.16 Exact-category spectra and invariance

For the IK spectrum of §11.5, identify its envelope structure maps with those from localization. The preceding completed-level equivalence computes its groups; spectrum localization supplies exactness; and a derived equivalence induced by a pair map supplies stable invariance. For exact categories use their bounded-complex Frobenius model with the acyclic subpair. Its positive groups recover Quillen K, while its degree zero is K₀ of the idempotent-completed derived category.

Use split-complex Frobenius structures, ℤ-indexed complexes and Gillet–Waldhausen. The acyclic subpair is thick and contains projective-injectives.

(Schlichting 2003, D 11.1 and 11.4, L 11.3, pp.20–21;T 11.7, p.21;T 11.10 and §11.13, pp.21–22;P 11.15, p.22.)

*Needs:* §11.5; §11.7; §10.10; §11.11; §11.14; §11.15.

### Examples

The identity Frobenius pair has zero derived quotient. The even-Euler subcategory of Dᵇ(k) is dense with quotient class group ℤ/2. Its inclusion is not an equivalence, illustrating the cofinality condition used by completion.

### Dependencies

Layers 1, 4–6 and 10; supplied Frobenius stable categories, Verdier localization and idempotent completion.

## Layer 12: Karoubi filtrations, finite domination and comparison

### 12.1 Karoubi’s direct filtration in the discrete additive case

For a strictly full additive A⊂U, define a direct A-filtration as directed split decompositions X=A_i⊕X_i for each X∈U. Every map from an A-object into X factors through some A_i, and every map from X into an A-object factors through its projection to some A_i. Require compatibility with finite direct sums and refinement of both types of factorization simultaneously. Maps factoring through A form a two-sided additive ideal; construct U/A with the same objects and Hom groups modulo this ideal.

Use discrete exact factorizations and closure under finite direct sums. U/A is an additive ideal quotient.

(Karoubi 1970, §1 D 1.5,P 1.7–1.9,L 1.11,PDF9–21.)

Use:

- `KaroubiFiltration`: Actual split directed decompositions and the F1–F4 conditions.
- `KaroubiFiltration.finiteIdeal`: Morphisms factoring through an A-object.
- `KaroubiFiltration.quotient`: Same objects and quotient Hom groups.
- `KaroubiFiltration.zeroObjects`: Zero quotient objects are precisely the A-summand class.

**Checks.**

- For A=U the quotient is zero; id_X factors through the A-object X.
- For A=0 the factorization ideal is zero and U/A=U.
- In row-and-column-finite sequence matrices, the projection to the first n coordinates splits and every map to or from a finite sequence factors through a sufficiently long truncation.
- A column-finite matrix with a nonzero entry in every column of its first row has no finite truncation through which that row map factors; it is excluded by row finiteness.

*Needs:* §11.1; `CategoryTheory.Idempotents.Karoubi`.

### 12.2 The finite-defect index and the cone boundary

For the completed quotient functor U^♮→(U/A)^♮, identify its relative triple group with K₀(A^♮). A quotient automorphism gives an index in that group by lifting its matrix to a split decomposition and comparing its finite defect summands. The relative-triple five-term sequence becomes K₁ᶜˡ(U)→K₁ᶜˡ(U/A)→K₀(A^♮)→K₀(U^♮)→K₀((U/A)^♮). For a flasque U, additivity annihilates its absolute K₀ and K₁ᶜˡ, making the index boundary an isomorphism.

Use the classical stabilized additive-category automorphism K₁ and relative triples of Layer 4. This argument does not require the later relative ring π₁ adapter. Without these completions A=U would yield K₀(A), which can be smaller than K₀(A^♮).

(Karoubi 1970, §2 T 2.13 proof,P 2.16,PDF36–40;§3 swindle and boundary,PDF50–51.)

**Checks.**

- For A=U the completed quotient is zero and the relative group is K₀(A^♮).
- Finite free modules over k×k have K₀=ℤ with diagonal image in K₀(A^♮)=ℤ²; (1,0) is outside that image.
- For A=0 the relative completed quotient is the identity and its relative group is zero.

*Needs:* §12.1; §4.17; §10.1.

### 12.3 Karoubi’s derived groups from a flasque cone

Construct controlled additive cone CA: objects are countable sequences using finitely many A-object types; morphisms are finite sums of permutant matrices in the discrete version of the source. Establish closure under composition, its additive structure, and a shift swindle. Finite sequences give a directly filtered copy of A. Define SA=CA/A and Kar_{−n}(A)=K₀((SⁿA)^♮), with the source’s completion convention at each iteration. The cone index yields natural localization boundaries for direct filtrations.

A is small additive. Use controlled matrix morphisms and degree-zero idempotent completion.

(Karoubi 1970, §1 example3/Thm1.6,PDF11–13;§3 Thm3.2/3.10,Def3.11,Props3.12–14,Thms3.21/3.23,PDF41–57.)

Use:

- `KaroubiCone`: Finite-type countable sequences and the controlled matrix Hom groups.
- `KaroubiCone.swindle`: repeated-sequence functor and natural id⊕T≅T.
- `KaroubiSuspension`: direct-filtered quotient CA/A.
- `KaroubiNegative`: K0 of the idempotent completion of each iterated suspension.
- `KaroubiNegative.boundary`: Natural direct-filtration localization boundaries.

**Checks.**

- An old finite sequence becomes zero in the suspension.
- Adding the initial column to ℕ×ℕ is absorbed by a bijection.
- Arbitrary column-finite matrices without the source’s row/control condition are not silently admitted as morphisms.

*Needs:* §12.1; §12.2.

### 12.4 Compare Karoubi’s negative groups with Bass contractions

For A=P(R), identify the cone-derived groups Kar_{−n}(A) with LⁿK₀(R). Use the discrete norm to identify the source’s summable polynomial series with finite central polynomials, verify the four negative axioms for the cone theory, and invoke cone uniqueness. Prove compatibility with polynomial and Laurent chart maps and their boundaries. The source’s positive superscript Kⁿ denotes the present degree −n.

For n≥0. The comparison is algebraic and in nonpositive degrees; no topological Bott periodicity is asserted.

(Karoubi 1971, §II.2.1–2.7,pp.66–72;§III.3.2 and preceding construction,pp.73–74.)

*Needs:* §12.2; §12.3; §10.3; §10.4.

### 12.5 Finite domination of a chain complex

Define A-domination of a bounded U-complex V by a finite A-complex D, chain maps f:V→D and g:D→V, and a chain homotopy gf≃id_V. Record the finite support explicitly; shift it into nonnegative degrees for the matrix formula. The composite fg is a homotopy idempotent and must be rectified before interpreting it as an object of the idempotent completion.

A→U is fully faithful additive. HomologicalComplex and Homotopy supply the carriers; fg is only homotopy idempotent.

(Ranicki, §3 P 3.1 and relative P 3.2,pp118–123/PDF14–19.)

Use:

- `FiniteChainDomination`: finite A-complex D, chain maps f,g and homotopy gf≃id.
- `FiniteChainDomination.transport`: Transport along a chain homotopy equivalence.
- `FiniteChainDomination.fg`: fg is idempotent up to the induced homotopy.
- `FiniteChainDomination.sum`: Direct sums of the given finite dominations.

**Checks.**

- A finite A-complex has f=g=id,h=0.
- A contractible complex is dominated by the zero complex.
- A supplied homotopy (fg)²≃fg does not justify an idempotent-completion object (D,fg).

*Needs:* §12.1.

### 12.6 Turn finite domination into a finite idempotent complex

From a finite domination form the corrected idempotent p on F=⊕D_i using the alternating differential matrix with entries fg, 1−fg, ±d and the higher fh^kg terms. Verify p²=p using the chain-homotopy equation, and construct a finite A^♮-complex homotopy equivalent to V in U^♮. Its class is [F,p]−[D_odd]. At an odd upper support bound the top projection is 1−p; combining the complementary summands gives the same displayed Euler formula. Its image in K₀(U^♮) is the Euler class of V.

Use the source homotopy convention throughout. Correct fg to an actual p; shifting once negates Euler class.

(Ranicki, P 3.1 full proof,pp118–122/PDF14–18;P 3.2,123/PDF19.)

Use:

- `FiniteDomination.idempotent`: actual finite block idempotent p on ⊕D_i.
- `FiniteDomination.finiteModel`: truncated complex E in A^♮ with the parity-dependent top idempotent.
- `FiniteDomination.modelEquivalence`: Chain homotopy equivalence V≃E in U^♮.
- `FiniteDomination.euler`: [V]=[F,p]−[D_odd], including its image in U^♮.

**Checks.**

- If f,g split strictly and D has only degree0, p=fg is the usual projector.
- For identity domination the Euler class is the usual alternating sum of D_i.
- At top degree 1 with p=1, the complementary projector 1−p is 0; using p would give 1.

*Needs:* §12.5.

### 12.7 Return from restricted completion

A bounded A^♮-complex is homotopy equivalent to a bounded A-complex exactly when its Euler class lies in im(K₀A→K₀A^♮). Prove this by adding complementary elementary complexes and moving the last remaining summand to a single degree. For A⊂U put H=(K₀A^♮→K₀U^♮)⁻¹(im K₀U). An A-dominated U-complex has a finite model over A^H, the full objects whose classes lie in H, after adjoining those objects to U. This is the restricted completion needed in the quotient fibre.

Take the image in K₀(U^♮). The obstruction is membership in that image, not zero in the ambient group.

(Ranicki, P 2.1, pp.115–116;P 3.2, pp.122–123;Cárdenas–Pedersen, §5 and §7.4, pp.10–14, 20–21.)

*Needs:* §12.6.

### 12.8 Lift a quotient complex through a Karoubi filtration

For a direct A-filtration of U, lift a bounded U/A-complex to a bounded U-complex up to isomorphism in the quotient. Lift finitely many differential representatives, factor their finitely many nonzero composites through a common A-summand, and enlarge the complex by contractible summands to correct d² to zero. Similarly, lift a quotient contraction after a common refinement. A bounded U-complex becomes contractible in U/A precisely when it is A-dominated.

Use simultaneous source/target factorizations, with A additive and containing zero; arbitrary quotient lifts need not square to zero.

(Carlsson–Pedersen, P 4.7;proof of T 4.1, pp.751–752;Cárdenas–Pedersen, §7.2–7.5, pp.18–21.)

*Needs:* §12.1; §12.5.

### 12.9 Karoubi complex approximation

On bounded U-complexes take degreewise split inflations as cofibrations and chain-homotopy equivalences as ordinary weak equivalences. Enlarge weak equivalences to maps becoming homotopy equivalences over U/A. Corrected quotient lifting and the standard mapping cylinder prove approximation to C(U/A). Its acyclic fibre is K-equivalent to C(A^H), using finite domination and restricted completion. The same corrections identify the associated Verdier quotient after the restricted completion.

H is the preimage subgroup of §12.7. All complexes are bounded and all mapping-cylinder and quotient maps are explicit.

(Cárdenas–Pedersen, §§4–6 and §7.1–7.9, pp.9–24;Schlichting 2003, T 7.1, pp.14–15.)

*Needs:* §12.8; §12.7; §6.8; §6.3; §6.18.

### 12.10 Cone–Frobenius comparison

For small idempotent-complete additive A with its split exact structure, apply the bounded-complex Frobenius construction to A→CA→SA. The controlled filtration, corrected complex lifting and restricted-completion approximation prove this is an exact sequence of the needed pair models. The cone swindle and IK localization identify IK_{−n}(A)≅K₀((SⁿA)^♮). For A=P(R), the Karoubi–Bass comparison identifies these groups with Bass K_{−n}(R), naturally and with the same cone boundary.

At later suspensions retain the idempotent-completion convention. For non-idempotent-complete A the degree-zero term is completion-corrected.

(Schlichting 2003, T 7.1;proof, pp.14–15;Cárdenas–Pedersen, §7.1–7.9, pp.18–24.)

*Needs:* §12.9; §12.3; §11.15; §11.8; §12.4.

### 12.11 Agreement and vanishing

Complete the natural comparison among the Bass, controlled-cone and Frobenius negative groups for rings, and between the cone and Frobenius groups for additive categories. For a small exact E, present IK₋₁(E) as the direct-sum monoid of idempotents in the unbounded derived category, modulo those that split; prove IK₋₁(E)=0 exactly when D(E) is idempotent complete. Prove IK₋₁=0 for every small abelian category, and IK_{−n}=0 for every n≥1 for a small noetherian abelian category. regular noetherian rings in the finite-global-dimension scope have zero negative groups. General abelian all-negative vanishing is false: Neeman gives an abelian category with nonzero K₋₂.

The all-negative abelian claim requires every object noetherian. The unbounded derived model uses admissible acyclicity and actual idempotents; the 2003 conjecture is not assumed.

(Schlichting 2003, T 7.1 and proof, pp.14–15;Remark 7.2, p.15;L 8.1 and C 8.2, p.15;T 9.1, p.16;T 9.3, pp.16–17;Examples 9.5–9.6, p.17;Neeman, §§0,5, pp.1–2,20–21.)

*Needs:* §11.16; §11.8; §10.3; §10.13; §12.4; §12.10.

### Examples

For ranks 2,3 in degrees 0,1, the Euler class is 2−3=−1. At top degree 1, p=1 gives complementary projector 0. An arbitrary column-finite first row cannot be absorbed by a finite truncation; the controlled matrix condition matters.

### Dependencies

Layers 1, 5–6 and 10–11; additive quotient ideals, chain homotopies and actual idempotents.

## Layer 13: Continuity and the limits of derived invariance

### 13.1 The nonunital extension of the Bass spectrum

Define Kᴮ_nu(I)=fib(Kᴮ(ℤ⋉I)→Kᴮ(ℤ)), functorially for nonunital homomorphisms. For unital I, the decomposition (z,a)↦(z,z1+a) identifies the augmentation with the first projection ℤ×I→ℤ, hence the fibre with Kᴮ(I). On nonpositive homotopy groups compare this spectrum definition with the early reduced Bass-contraction groups; split augmentation and finite-product compatibility identify them.

The fibre is a spectrum fibre and uses the canonical augmentation. I need not have an identity.

(Weibel, §II.2.7.2, p.76;§IV.6.3.5–6.4, p.321;§IV.10.4, p.350.)

Use:

- `NonunitalBass`: fibre of K^B of the unitization augmentation.
- `NonunitalBass.map`: nonunital ring map induces the fibre map.
- `NonunitalBass.unitalEquiv`: For unital A, K^B_nu(A)≃K^B(A).

**Checks.**

- A=0 gives fib(id:K^B(ℤ)→K^B(ℤ)), hence zero spectrum.
- For A=ℤ the unitization is ℤ×ℤ and the fibre is the second K^B(ℤ).
- For the corner ℤ→M₂(ℤ), the second component sends (z,c) to diag(c,z), not diag(c,0); ignoring z breaks unitality.

*Needs:* §8.3; §8.1; §10.10; §10.11; §3.2; Layer 1; §10.3.

### 13.2 Nonunital idempotent extension

For an additive multiplicative h:A→B between unital rings, put e=h(1). Under the unital fibre identifications, the map of nonunital Bass spectra agrees with the map induced by P↦P⊗_A eB on right finite projectives. Prove this at the connective projective-functor level using the unitization block decomposition, then at each Λ-stage by naturality. The earlier group-level corner adapter is thereby promoted to a spectrum comparison.

h need not preserve one. Since e²=e and h(a)e=eh(a)=h(a), eB is a unital left A-module and a finite projective right B-module.

(Weibel, §II.2.7.2, p.76;§IV.6.3.5–6.4, p.321;block tensor calculation in §3.5.)

*Needs:* §13.1; §10.6; §3.2.

### 13.3 Corner embeddings become identity under matrix Morita

For n≥1 and the upper-left corner h_n:M_nR→M_{n+1}R, compose its idempotent-extension functor with the standard column-bimodule Morita functors. The composite identifies naturally with the same finite-projective R-module. Deduce that Kᴮ_nu(h_n) becomes id on Kᴮ(R), coherently for any number of corner steps. In unitization coordinates the map is (z,c)↦(z,diag(c,z)); diag(c,0) is the nonunital corner map before that coordinate change.

The matrix index is finite nonempty. Specify both maps and their Morita comparisons.

(Weibel, §II.2.7.1–2.7.2, p.76;§III.4.4, pp.213–214.)

*Needs:* §13.2; §10.6.

### 13.4 Filtered continuity and products

Extend the early connective finite-product and filtered-colimit comparisons to Kᴮ in every integer degree. Central polynomial and Laurent extensions commute with filtered colimits; finite direct sums and cokernels preserve them, so all Bass groups do too. The canonical spectrum maps are equivalences by their homotopy-group isomorphisms. Finite ring products give finite products of Kᴮ spectra. For the nonunital matrix union use §13.5; no assertion about infinite ring products follows.

Ring diagrams and filtered indexing categories are small. Product cardinality is finite. Frobenius nonpositive continuity is already §11.8.

(Weibel, II.2, the paragraph after Example 2.1.3, p.69;IV.6.4, p.321;IV.6.4, the filtered-colimit clause, p.321;Schlichting 2003, L 6.3 and C 6.4, pp.13–14.)

*Needs:* §3.2; §2.6; §10.3; §10.11; §11.8; §10.6; `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasFilteredColimits`; §8.3; §8.1.

### 13.5 Filtered continuity of the nonunital Bass spectrum

For a small filtered nonunital-ring diagram I_a, prove hocolim_a Kᴮ_nu(I_a)≃Kᴮ_nu(colim_a I_a). Unitization commutes with its filtered colimit; unital Kᴮ continuity and exactness of filtered spectrum colimits allow passage through the augmentation fibre. Apply this to the finite corner diagram, using its coherent Morita comparisons, to identify Kᴮ_nu(M∞R) with Kᴮ(R) under the actual corner inclusion.

Use finite-data descent at each Bass stage to establish unital continuity first. Transition maps may be noninjective and need not preserve an identity.

### 13.6 Derived invariance needs an enhancement, not a triangulated equivalence

For DG perfect-module categories supplied by the DG roadmap, an exact DG model map inducing the derived perfect equivalence gives a K-equivalence when carried by its Waldhausen or Frobenius models. For a Morita bimodule equivalence use its derived tensor model and inverse; roof strictification or approximation provides the connective comparison and the pair-map theorem the nonconnective comparison. Record the enhancement and actual model functor as hypotheses. A bare equivalence of triangulated perfect categories does not supply these data.

DGAInfinity Layers 5–7 supply perfect modules, Morita bimodules and DG quotients. Apply the bounded/exact model comparisons of Layers 6,11; general stable-∞ K-theory is separate.

### 13.7 Relative and transfer compatibility

Extend the ring-spectrum pairing through the Λ tower, checking its two central-variable suspension squares and sphere interchanges. This induces integer-graded products, fibre-module products for relative spectra, and graded commutativity for commutative rings. For a localization sequence prove ∂(y·x)=(−1)^deg(y)y·∂x and ∂(x·y)=∂x·y in the chosen right-module convention. Transfer compatibility follows from the natural tensor/restriction isomorphism; finite-resolution transfers require the same resolving hypotheses as Layer 7. The negative Laurent contraction section is multiplication by [t] first.

Relative products require a compatible biexact square. Boundaries have signed module linearity; no fibre-product derivation law is asserted. Retain connective units and coherence.

(Weibel, V.3.12 (Projection Formula 3.12), p.395;IV.8.11 (Products), p.342.)

*Needs:* §7.4; §7.5; §10.10; §9.17; §7.7; §8.1.

### 13.8 Two Artin module models with equivalent triangulated stable categories

For an odd prime p, give the finite-module categories over ℤ/p² and 𝔽_p[ε]/ε² their Frobenius exact structures. Their projective-injectives are the finite free modules. The stable quotient kills those and retains the simple modules; both stable categories are equivalent to finite-dimensional 𝔽_p vector spaces, with suspension isomorphic to the identity and the induced split triangulated structure. Inflations and stable isomorphisms give the Waldhausen models.

Objects are finitely generated modules over these Artin rings. Use the stable Frobenius quotient and triangulation; p is odd as in the cited comparison.

(Schlichting 2002, §§0.2–0.3,1.1–1.4,pp.112–113.)

Use:

- `ArtinStableModel`: Finite modules with monic cofibrations and stable-isomorphism weak equivalences.
- `ArtinStableModel.projectiveInjective`: free modules are the projective-injective objects.
- `ArtinStableModel.simpleEquivalence`: Stable category≃finite𝔽_p vector spaces.
- `ArtinStableModel.suspension`: Multiplication by p or ε identifies suspension with identity.

**Checks.**

- At p=3 the rings are ℤ/9 and 𝔽₃[ε]/ε². Their free modules have zero stable class, whereas the simple 𝔽₃ has nonzero stable identity.
- The sequence 0→𝔽_p→R→𝔽_p→0, with the first map multiplication by p or ε, identifies suspension of the simple with itself. It is not a split module sequence.
- The zero module represents zero in both stable categories, and adding a free summand leaves a stable object unchanged.
- A bare triangulated equivalence between these models cannot be promoted to a K-equivalence merely from its action on simple objects; §13.10 gives different K₄ p-primary groups.

*Needs:* §11.1; §11.2.

### 13.9 The K-theory fibration for each Artin stable module model

Compare the isomorphism and stable weak-equivalence classes on the finite-module model. Factorization fibration, dévissage to 𝔽_p, and the projective acyclic fibre give K(R)→K(𝔽_p)→K(mM(R)). Its homotopy sequence and K₄(𝔽_p)=0 identify K₄(mM(R)) with ker(K₃R→K₃𝔽_p). This reduces the counterexample to the numerical finite-ring groups used below.

Use the opposite factorization apparatus when needed. The symbol mM specifies the category with stable weak equivalences, rather than the stable quotient as a bare category.

(Schlichting 2002, §§1.5–1.6,pp.113–114.)

*Needs:* §13.8; §6.14; §4.8.

### 13.10 A triangulated-invariance counterexample

Apply the preceding fibre computation and Schlichting’s published finite-ring counterexample proposition. For odd p, the p-primary part of K₄(mM(ℤ/p²)) is cyclic of order p², whereas that of K₄(mM(𝔽_p[ε]/ε²)) is (ℤ/p)². The two model K-theories are inequivalent despite the triangulated equivalence of their stable categories. At p=3 an element of order 9 exists on the first side and no such element exists on the second, so an abstract group comparison already distinguishes them.

Use published Proposition 1.7 and its cited finite-ring K₃ calculations, for odd p only; no new general Artin K₃ calculation is asserted.

(Schlichting 2002, §§1.6–1.7,p.114;§2.1–2.2,pp.114–115.)

*Needs:* §13.9; §13.8.

### Examples

For the corner map, (z,c) maps to (z,diag(c,z)) after unitization. For p=3, ℤ/9 and 𝔽₃[ε]/ε² have equivalent triangulated stable categories, but their K₄ p-primary groups are respectively cyclic of order 9 and (ℤ/3)².

### Dependencies

Layers 3, 7–8 and 10–12; the DGAInfinity perfect-model and enhanced Morita supplier contracts.

## Downstream consumers

KTheoryLowDegrees uses the ring K₀/K₁ comparisons, stable matrices, relative triples and projective patching. K2SymbolsBrauer and K3BlochGroups use the resulting general K-groups before adding their field-specific presentations. Scheme and arithmetic K-theory use resolution, localization, transfers and the Fundamental Theorem. DGAInfinity and consumers of perfect complexes use enhanced derived invariance with a model map. Stable homotopy and homological invariants can consume the spectrum pairing and exactness interface without identifying a bare triangulated category with its K-theory.
