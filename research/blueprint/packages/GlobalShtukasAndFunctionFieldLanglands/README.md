# Roadmap: global shtukas and Langlands over function fields

**Summary.** Let X be a smooth projective geometrically connected curve over a finite field F_q, with function field F, and let G be a connected reductive group over F. This roadmap constructs the moduli stacks of G-bundles on X with level structure, the Beilinson–Drinfeld Grassmannians and Hecke stacks over the powers X^I, and the stacks of G-shtukas with any finite set of legs, together with their ℓ-adic cohomology with rational, integral and torsion coefficients. From the geometric Satake equivalence over finite fields, partial Frobenius and Drinfeld's lemma it builds excursion operators on the space of cuspidal automorphic functions and proves V. Lafforgue's theorem: the cusp space of every level decomposes canonically, compatibly with all Hecke operators, along semisimple global Langlands parameters σ : Gal(F̄/F) → ᴸG(Q̄_ℓ), and at every good place the spherical Hecke operators act through the Satake parameter of σ(Frob_v) (VL, Theorems 11.11 and 12.3). It adds Xue's theorems on the integral finiteness, Weil descent and ind-smoothness of the cohomology of shtukas; the modular (mod ℓ) version of the decomposition; Yun–Zhang's PGL₂ shtukas with fractional infinity and the Eisenstein decomposition of their middle cohomology; and Genestier–Lafforgue's local parameterization, which attaches a semisimple parameter to every irreducible smooth representation over a local function field through the completed Bernstein centre and proves local–global compatibility up to semisimplification at every place, with local gamma factors. For GL_r it builds on L. Lafforgue's global correspondence, which AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors provides, to remove the finite-determinant hypothesis, to construct ℓ-adic companions on curves and to identify the two constructions of parameters.

## Scope and ownership

This roadmap owns, for a global function field F = F_q(X) and a connected reductive group G over F:

- the stack of 𝒢-bundles for a smooth affine model 𝒢 with connected fibres, with full level structures, Iwahori flags and fractional twists; Harder–Narasimhan data for coherent sheaves and G-bundles, with the shifted and the parabolic PGL₂ variants; the adelic description of the F_q-points, central lattices, orbit masses, the mass formulas for bundles and torsion sheaves, and the interface with cuspidal automorphic functions (Layer GS.0);
- the Beilinson–Drinfeld Grassmannian over X^I, Schubert bounds, global and Iwahori Hecke stacks, ℓ-adic sheaves on algebraic stacks of finite type, fusion, the classical (equal-characteristic, finite-field, ℓ-adic) geometric Satake equivalence with its sign and Tate normalizations, its comparison with spherical functions, nonsplit descent through the L-group and the integral version (Layer GS.1);
- the stacks of global shtukas, their truncations and local models, their cohomology sheaves in all degrees, partial Frobenius, coalescence of legs and Hecke correspondences, including Yun–Zhang's fractional-infinity shtukas and the PGL₂ horocycles (Layer GS.2);
- creation and annihilation of legs, the Eichler–Shimura relation, Hecke finiteness, cuspidal cohomology and its integral finiteness, finiteness over one local Hecke algebra, and the PGL₂ Eisenstein decomposition (Layer GS.3);
- Drinfeld's lemma, the Frobenius–Weil group, the product Galois action on Hecke-finite cohomology, the functors H_{I,W}, Weil descent and ind-smoothness of the full cohomology (Layer GS.4);
- global excursion operators and V. Lafforgue's decomposition, with its nonsplit, integral and modular versions (Layer GS.5);
- constant twists and companions on curves, and the comparison of excursion parameters with the GL_r correspondence (Layer GS.6);
- restricted shtukas, nearby cycles over higher-dimensional bases, local excursion elements, the Genestier–Lafforgue parameterization, local–global compatibility, local gamma factors and the GL_r comparison with monodromy at every place (Layer GS.7).

Its boundaries with neighbouring roadmaps are as follows.

- **AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3** (section *Curve arithmetic and the unramified pure realization*) owns L. Lafforgue's proof of the global Langlands correspondence for GL_r over F at every level: slopes, HN filtrations, their semicontinuity and the bounded loci of vector bundles on X; two-leg Drinfeld shtukas with and without level, their truncations and compactifications; lower-rank counting with a leg in the level; normalized intersection-complex purity and the essential comparison; the negligible-constituent criterion, essential cohomology and the counting comparison through the truncated trace formula; rank-one reciprocity with and without ramification; the function-field converse theorem and strong multiplicity one; and the induction on the rank, with all-place pair factors and temperedness. Layers GS.6 and GS.7 use that theorem and restate none of it. The G-bundle HN theory of Layer GS.0 agrees with AL.3 on vector bundles, and the stack description of rank-one shtukas in Layer GS.0 is what the horocycle computations here need.
- **EndoscopicTransferAndUnitaryTraceComparison** §3.1 constructs Bun_G for a quasi-split group scheme that is reductive over all of X, and §3.2 the equal-characteristic local loop Grassmannian LG/L⁺G. [§GS.0.1 *Bundles on the global curve*](#gs-0-bun-g-of-the-global-curve) extends the first to models that are reductive only over an open U, and [§GS.1.1 *Beilinson–Drinfeld Grassmannians*](#gs-1-beilinson-drinfeld-grassmannian) builds the multi-leg Grassmannian whose fibre over a point is the second.
- **FunctionFieldArithmetic** owns the adeles, ideles, class field theory, zeta functions, automorphic function spaces and constant terms of a global function field. **AlgebraicCurves** owns function fields of curves, places, divisors and Riemann–Roch; **JacobianChallenge** owns the Picard functor, the Jacobian and the Abel–Jacobi map; **AlgebraicVectorBundles** owns finite locally free sheaves; **SchemeAndStackFoundations** owns algebraic spaces and stacks, torsors, descent, deformation theory and Quot schemes; **ReductiveGroups** and **ReductiveGroupsPartII** own reductive groups, root data, dual groups and L-groups.
- **EtaleCohomologyFoundations** and **EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheaves** own étale cohomology of schemes: constructible coefficients, base change, duality, perverse sheaves, weights, cohomological correspondences and their trace formulas; **DeligneWeightsAndPurity** owns weights and purity. Neither treats algebraic stacks; [§GS.1.4 *ℓ-adic sheaves on stacks of finite type*](#gs-1-l-adic-sheaves-on-stacks) extends the operations this roadmap needs to stacks of finite type. **EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheavesPartII** owns oriented products of topoi, and **LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles** owns nearby cycles over a henselian trait; Orgogozo's nearby cycles over higher-dimensional bases are part of [§GS.7.3 *Nearby cycles over higher-dimensional bases*](#gs-7-nearby-cycles-over-general-bases).
- **LanglandsParameterStacks** owns excursion algebras, excursion data and the reconstruction of parameters from their pseudocharacters for an arbitrary group; this roadmap verifies the hypotheses on the cohomology of shtukas and proves continuity for the global Galois group. **IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants** owns determinants and their reconstruction.
- **SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups** owns Hecke algebras over rings, the Bernstein centre, parabolic induction and the classical Satake isomorphism.
- **ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations** §§2.5–2.7 owns local Euler factors and local constants in its finite-extension-of-Q_p setting. The equal-characteristic local constants and function-field product formula are supplied by **AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors** §AL.3, *Function-field local factors, multiplicity one and converse theorem*. §GS.7.10 uses that prefix to construct gamma factors for reductive groups.
- **GeometricSatakeAndFusion** owns geometric Satake for the B_dR-Grassmannian over the Fargues–Fontaine curve; the classical equal-characteristic equivalence is Layer GS.1 here. **HeckeStacksAndLocalShtukas** and **ExcursionOperatorsAndSpectralAction** own local shtukas, their cohomology, the spectral action and the equal-characteristic local Langlands correspondence for GL_r.
- **DrinfeldModulesAndTModules** owns Drinfeld modules and elliptic sheaves; [§GS.2.7 *Elliptic sheaves as a specialization*](#gs-2-elliptic-sheaf-realisation) compares elliptic sheaves with one-leg shtukas.
- Drinfeld's companions on smooth varieties of higher dimension are not part of this roadmap.

## Conventions

Throughout, k = F_q has characteristic p and X/k is a smooth projective geometrically connected curve of genus g, with function field F, adele ring A, completions F_v with integers O_v and residue fields κ_v of size q_v = q^{deg v}. The generic group G/F is connected reductive, with a chosen smooth affine model 𝒢 over X with connected fibres, reductive over a nonempty open U ⊂ X; the constant split case comes first, and every nonsplit statement says how it descends. A **level** N is a finite closed subscheme of X, nilpotents included; a parabolic or Iwahori flag at a point is different data. A central lattice Ξ ⊂ Z(F)\Z(A) is a discrete subgroup that controls the central degree directions (for GL_n, the powers a^Z of an idele a of nonzero degree).

For sheaves, ℓ ≠ p and E is a finite extension of Q_ℓ, large enough for the representations in use, with integers O_E and uniformizer λ; a torsion coefficient ring is O_E/λ^s for a stated s. Frob_v denotes a geometric Frobenius element at v, the inverse of arithmetic Frobenius, and traces in the sheaf–function dictionary are traces of geometric Frobenius. Class field theory is normalized so that the arithmetic Artin map sends a uniformizer to arithmetic Frobenius; a rank-one automorphic character χ then corresponds to the Galois character whose geometric-Frobenius value at v is χ(π_v), that is, χ(a) = ρ(Art(a)⁻¹), as in AL.3. One square root of q is fixed for half Tate twists, and q_v is used at a place of degree deg v. For nonsplit G, ᴸG = Ĝ ⋊ Gal(F̃/F) is the finite form of the L-group attached to a finite Galois extension F̃/F over which a pinning splits; parameters valued in ᴸG carry the prescribed projection to Gal(F̃/F). Spherical Hecke algebras use the Haar measure with vol(G(O_v)) = 1; the normalized spherical function h_{V,v} differs from the trace of the perverse Satake sheaf by the sign (−1)^{⟨2ρ,ω⟩} of the orbit dimension. Additive local factors use the additive character of a global differential and the corresponding self-dual measures (FunctionFieldArithmetic FA.2).

In a shtuka, τ is pullback along id_X × Frob_S. The ordered partition of the legs and the bound on each modification are part of the data. A fixed HN bound is not invariant under Hecke operators or partial Frobenius: these maps may increase the bound, so they act on the directed system of truncations. The groupoid of F_q-points of a stack keeps its automorphisms and, for nonsplit G, its components indexed by the pure inner forms.

Three finiteness conditions are kept apart. A vector is **Hecke-finite** when it lies in a finitely generated O_E-submodule stable under every integral Hecke operator. The full cohomology can be a finite module over one local Hecke algebra while being infinite over O_E. The untruncated cohomology ind-sheaf can be ind-smooth without being one lisse sheaf of finite rank. Likewise, the excursion decomposition is by generalized eigenspaces; reducedness of the excursion algebra is not asserted. The spherical Hecke operators act by scalars on each block in the characteristic-zero theorem, by a separate adjointness argument; in the modular theory they have generalized eigenvalues.

## How to read the build

Layer GS.0 builds Bun_𝒢 with its level structures, flags and HN data, and identifies its F_q-points with adelic double cosets. Layer GS.1 builds the Beilinson–Drinfeld Grassmannian and Hecke stacks, extends ℓ-adic sheaf theory to the stacks that occur, and proves the geometric Satake equivalence over finite fields with its global, nonsplit and integral variants. Layer GS.2 constructs shtukas as Hecke stacks pulled back along Frobenius, with their cohomology sheaves, partial Frobenius, coalescence and Hecke operators. Layer GS.3 controls this cohomology: creation and annihilation, the Eichler–Shimura relation, Hecke finiteness and cuspidality, and the PGL₂ boundary analysis. Layer GS.4 proves Drinfeld's lemma and constructs the product Galois actions. Layer GS.5 builds excursion operators and proves the global decomposition. Layer GS.6 adds constant twists, companions and the GL_r comparison on top of AL.3. Layer GS.7 constructs the local parameterization and proves the comparisons at every place.

Each target states its hypotheses, its proof route with sources, the API a reusable formalization needs, and its Checks. `Suggested.lean` gives the targets whose carriers exist in Mathlib at the pins: integral Hecke finiteness and its finite witnesses, the monic-recurrence bound behind the Frobenius box, the excursion algebra of a family of endomorphisms with its generalized-eigenspace decomposition, matrix coefficients of a representation of a product group, and the numerical Euler form, slope and shifted slope on classes of coherent sheaves. Stacks, sheaves and cohomology have no carrier at the pins and are specified here only.

## Layer GS.0: bundles, levels and adelic geometry

This layer builds the moduli of bundles on the curve and its adelic description. Three distinctions run through it: a full level structure (a trivialization on a finite subscheme that keeps its nilpotents) is different data from an Iwahori flag; a weighted stack volume is different from an unweighted count of isomorphism classes; and Harder–Narasimhan instability, measured in the adjoint group, does not bound the central degree, which is controlled separately by a central lattice Ξ.

Standing hypotheses for this layer: X is a smooth projective geometrically connected curve over k = F_q with function field F; the generic group G/F is connected reductive with a chosen smooth affine model 𝒢/X with connected fibres, reductive over a nonempty open U (split statements use the constant split model); bundle statements are over arbitrary k-schemes S. The Iwahori and shifted-HN targets are stated for GL_n or PGL_2, as indicated.

### GS.0.1 Bundles on the global curve

Define `BunG`. For X/F_q smooth projective geometrically connected and a smooth affine model 𝒢/X with connected fibres and reductive generic fibre G, Bun_𝒢(S) is the groupoid of fppf-locally trivial 𝒢-torsors on X×S and equivariant isomorphisms. It is an Artin stack locally of finite type with affine diagonal. Its geometric stabilizers are affine finite-type group schemes; stabilizers of rational objects have finitely many F_q-points.

*Construction.* Use effective fppf descent for torsors, including descent of arrows. For GL_n use the finite locally free sheaves of AlgebraicVectorBundles and bounded Quot charts; for the smooth model use a faithful representation and reductions of structure group. Represent the isomorphism sheaf by sections of the associated affine bundle, and use properness of X and finite presentation for the diagonal and stabilizer assertions.

*Remark.* Keep the stack, its groupoid of F_q-points and its set of isomorphism classes distinct.

*Remark.* GL_n-torsors recover the rank-n vector bundles of AlgebraicVectorBundles.

*Remark.* For a quasi-split model that is reductive over all of X this is the fixed-curve stack `CurveBundles` of EndoscopicTransferAndUnitaryTraceComparison §3.1. This target adds smooth affine models with connected fibres that are reductive only over U (parahoric at the remaining points), the affine diagonal and the stabilizer statements, and restricts to §3.1 on reductive models.

The API:

- `BunG` (data): The fppf stack of torsors on X×S.
- `BunG.pullback` (functoriality): Pull back objects and arrows along S′→S with coherent composition.
- `BunG.atlas` (structure): A smooth surjective atlas locally of finite type.
- `BunG.isom` (characterisation): Represent the affine isomorphism sheaf, including all stabilizers.

**Checks.**

- For GL₁ the result is the Picard stack, with automorphism group F_q× at every rational line bundle.
- For a constant G the trivial torsor has rational automorphism group G(F_q).
- On P¹, the degree-zero GL₂ bundles O(m)⊕O(−m), m≥0, have unbounded instability; fixing degree alone does not give a finite-type stack.

### GS.0.2 Deformations of bundles

At a 𝒢-bundle E, infinitesimal automorphisms, tangent classes and obstructions are H⁰(X,ad E), H¹(X,ad E), H²(X,ad E). The last vanishes on the curve, so Bun_𝒢 is smooth of local dimension −χ(X,ad E). For constant reductive G this is (g−1)dim G; a ramified model uses its actual adjoint-bundle Euler characteristic.

*Proof.* Describe torsor lifts on an affine cover by Čech 1-cocycles with coefficients in ad E; changes of lift are 0-cochains. Coherent H² vanishes on a curve, which gives smoothness; Riemann–Roch gives the dimension after subtracting automorphisms. For Iwahori PGL₂ add one flag dimension at each geometric level point, which gives 3(g − 1) + deg Σ.

*Remark.* H⁰ is the Lie algebra of the stabilizer, not its group of points.

*Remark.* For G_m the dimension is g − 1, although Pic⁰ has dimension g: the stack has a B G_m factor.

*Needs:* [§GS.0.1 *Bundles on the global curve*](#gs-0-bun-g-of-the-global-curve); SchemeAndStackFoundations Layer 1 (§§1.1, 1.15–1.16 descent, torsors and contracted products; §§1.18–1.21 algebraic and Deligne–Mumford stacks, inertia and quotient stacks); SchemeAndStackFoundations Layer 4 (§4.1 torsors of lifts, §§4.3–4.5 deformation functors and obstruction theories).

<a id="gs-0-level-structures"></a>

### GS.0.3 Full level structures

Define `BunG.level`. For a finite closed subscheme N⊂X, Bun_{𝒢,N}(S) consists of a bundle E and a trivialization E|N×S≃𝒢|N×S. Forgetting the trivialization is a torsor under Res_{N/F_q}(𝒢|N), hence representable smooth and surjective. Full congruence level and parabolic flags are different moduli data.

*Construction.* Descend the trivialization with the torsor. Identify changes of trivialization with the Weil-restriction action and check simple transitivity fppf locally.

*Remark.* The finite subscheme retains nilpotents.

The API:

- `BunG.level` (data): Bundle with a specified full trivialization on N.
- `BunG.level.forget` (functoriality): Forget full level or restrict it to N′⊂N.
- `BunG.level.torsor` (characterisation): Identify the change-of-trivialization group scheme.

**Checks.**

- N=∅ gives Bun_𝒢.
- For GL_n at a rational reduced point the level group is GL_n/F_q; rational principal congruence level is ker(GL_n(Ov)→GL_n(κv)).
- For G_m at 2v, units 1+πa survive modulo π²: replacing N by its reduction loses level information.

*Needs:* [§GS.0.1 *Bundles on the global curve*](#gs-0-bun-g-of-the-global-curve).

<a id="gs-0-iwahori-bundles-and-fractional-twists"></a>

### GS.0.4 Iwahori flags and fractional twists

Define `IwahoriBundle`. Bun_n(Σ) consists of rank-n bundles with, at each x∈Σ, a periodic chain E⊃E(−x/n)⊃⋯⊃E(−x), whose n successive quotients are line bundles on x×S. Extend the chain periodically to define fractional twists E(D) for D supported at the level with coefficients in (1/n)Z; for nonrational points use the chosen residue-field sections over S∞. Bun_PGLn(Σ) is the Picard-stack quotient. Fractional twisting induces Atkin–Lehner automorphisms.

*Construction.* Use the finite locally free sheaves of AlgebraicVectorBundles; flags are given by locally free successive quotients, with no generic-position condition. Rotating the periodic lattice chain implements a 1/n twist; integral rotations are tensoring with O(x). Descend tensoring and fractional rotation through the Picard action, using residue-field base changes for the infinity coefficients.

*Remark.* Flags are retained when a moving leg meets Σ.

The API:

- `IwahoriBundle` (data): The periodic lattice chain, its inclusions and quotient line bundles.
- `IwahoriBundle.twist` (functoriality): Add allowed fractional divisors, with twist(D+D′)≃twist(D)∘twist(D′).
- `IwahoriBundle.pglQuotient` (equivalence): Quotient simultaneous tensoring by a line bundle.
- `IwahoriBundle.atkinLehner` (compatibility): On the PGL_n quotient, n rotations at x are the identity.

- n=1 adds no flag choice and a unit twist is tensoring by O(x).
- For n=2 the half-twist at x replaces the chain E⊃E(−x/2)⊃E(−x) by E(x/2)⊃E⊃E(−x/2), where E(x/2)=E(−x/2)⊗O(x); doing it twice gives tensoring by O(x), so on PGL₂ it is an involution, the Atkin–Lehner involution at x.
- A flag at a degree-d closed point has d geometric flag parameters after splitting; counting only one geometric flag gives the wrong dimension.

### GS.0.5 Slopes and Harder–Narasimhan data

Define `HNType` and `HNFiltration`. For a nonzero coherent sheaf F on X use class (rk F,deg F), slope deg/rk for positive rank and +∞ for torsion. The HN filtration has semistable quotients with strictly decreasing slopes. Its ordered quotient classes define an HN type. For a constant connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field, use its unique canonical parabolic reduction, characterized by semistability of the Levi bundle and a dominant parabolic-regular degree; project its rational coweight to the adjoint group to measure instability. On classes χ((r,d),(r′,d′))=(1−g)rr′+rd′−r′d. Truncations for the general nonsplit/parahoric model are constructed separately in §GS.0.6.

*Construction.* The Euler pairing follows from Riemann–Roch and Serre duality on X. First separate the maximal torsion subsheaf, then construct maximal destabilizing saturated subbundles and induct on the rank. The filtration on a geometric fibre is canonical. In a family the HN type can jump; relative sheaf filtrations belong on their HN strata, and no arbitrary-base-change assertion for a filtration on the whole family is made. For reductive G use Schieder's comparison theorem for parabolic reductions and his existence argument, keeping central degree separate from adjoint instability. In arbitrary positive characteristic the map from semistable parabolic reductions to the reduced HN stratum is an almost-isomorphism (finite with a single point in each geometric fibre), not an asserted isomorphism; do not infer uniqueness of reductions over nonreduced bases from uniqueness at geometric points.

*Remark.* The zero sheaf has the empty HN type; no slope is assigned to it. The total numerical function `slope` in `Suggested.lean` returns +∞ on every rank-zero pair, including (0,0); its value at (0,0) is not a slope of the zero sheaf.

*Remark.* For vector bundles, slope, semistability and the HN filtration are AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3, *Curve bundle slopes and Harder–Narasimhan filtrations*. This target adds torsion sheaves (slope +∞), the Euler pairing on classes and the canonical parabolic reductions of G-bundles, and agrees with AL.3 on vector bundles.

The API:

- `HNType` (data): Ordered ranks and degrees, or canonical parabolic/coweight data for G.
- `HNFiltration` (constructor): The canonical filtration with semistable decreasing-slope quotients.
- `HNFiltration.unique` (characterisation): Any filtration with these properties is the canonical one.
- `Curve.eulerClass` (compatibility): Hom minus Ext¹ equals the stated numerical pairing.
- `Curve.cohHereditary` (structure): Coh(X) is hereditary: Ext^i(F,F′)=0 for i≥2, so χ(F,F′)=dim Hom(F,F′)−dim Ext¹(F,F′) is the numerical pairing on classes.

**Checks.**

- O(2)⊕O(−1) on P¹ has slopes 2,−1, in this order.
- For a length-one skyscraper at a degree-d point the class is (0,d) and its slope is +∞.
- For O on a genus-g curve χ(O,O)=1−g; reversing the alternating degree term fails on O and O(1) on P¹.

### GS.0.6 Bounded bundle loci

HN≤μ is an open substack of Bun_G. For the general nonsplit group with connected parahoric model, choose a vector bundle V with trivialized determinant and a faithful embedding of the adjoint model into SL(V) with quasi-affine quotient. Define Bun_{G^ad}^{≤μ} by inverse image of the degree-zero vector-bundle HN open, and Bun_G^{≤μ} by pullback along G→G^ad. Changing this embedding gives cofinal systems of opens; intrinsic canonical parabolic reductions of arbitrary parahoric models are not assumed. Fixing the relevant central degrees (or quotienting by a suitable central lattice) makes its bounded components of finite type. For a fixed coherent-sheaf class each HN type has finitely many rational isomorphism classes; requiring all slopes ≥0 gives finitely many such types and classes. An adjoint HN bound alone does not bound degrees of the centre.

*Proof.* Embed the bounded bundle problem in bounded Quot families after twisting by a sufficiently positive divisor. Use bounded cohomology and finite generation to obtain finite-type atlases; prove openness by specialization of HN polygons. For coherent sheaves with slopes ≥0, ranks and nonnegative quotient degrees admit only finitely many decompositions of the fixed class.

*Remark.* For G_m the HN condition in the adjoint group is empty, but line-bundle degrees remain unbounded.

*Remark.* For GL₂ in degree zero, HN^{≤μ} excludes O(m) ⊕ O(−m) for all sufficiently large m.

*Remark.* For GL_r, openness and finite type of the bounded loci of vector bundles are AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3, *Harder–Narasimhan polygon semicontinuity* and *Bounded curve-bundle loci and shtuka truncations*; this target is the statement for G-bundles, with the central degree.

### GS.0.7 Adelic bundle groupoids

For the connected-fibre model 𝒢, Bun_{𝒢,N}(F_q) is equivalent to the disjoint union, over α∈ker¹(F,G), of quotient groupoids [Gα(F)\Gα(A)/Kα,N], where Gα is the pure inner form and Kα,N is transported integral/congruence level. Automorphisms correspond to Gα(F)∩gKα,Ng⁻¹. For split G the kernel is trivial in the situation of VL Remark 8.21.

The local–global input on torsors is part of this target: the finiteness of ker¹(F, G), the identification of its classes with the generic torsor classes that are locally trivial at every place, and the choice of the pure inner form G_α in each class. FunctionFieldArithmetic supplies the adeles, the ideles and the abelian class field theory, but not these nonabelian statements.

*Proof.* Trivialize at the generic point and completed local discs, retaining a generic torsor class when it is not trivial. Glue the local data and compare changes of trivialization; use connected fibres and Lang descent over finite residue fields. Identify stabilizers and the locally trivial generic classes; choose the inner form belonging to each class.

*Remark.* The index set classifies generic torsor components, not individual bundles.

*Remark.* For GL₁ isomorphism classes give divisor classes while stabilizers give F_q×.

<a id="gs-0-shifted-hn-filtration"></a>

### GS.0.8 Shifted Harder–Narasimhan filtrations

Define `ShiftedHN.semistable` and `ShiftedHN.filtration`. For n≥1 and a dominant real tuple T=(T₁≥⋯≥Tn) define T-semistability of rank-n E by deg F/r−(T₁+⋯+Tr)/r≤deg E/n−(ΣT)/n for every nonzero proper saturated rank-r subbundle. A quotient of ranks (a,b], with 0≤a<b≤n, uses μ_T=deg/(b−a)−(T_{a+1}+⋯+Tb)/(b−a). The canonical T-HN filtration has shifted-semistable quotients with decreasing shifted slopes; it is trivial exactly for T-semistability.

*Construction.* Translate the dominant truncation inequalities into shifted subbundle slopes. Existence and uniqueness of the canonical T-filtration are part of this target. Yu (§3.3.2) takes them from Chaudouard's Theorem 4.1.2; a direct proof is the standard Harder–Narasimhan argument applied to the shifted degree d_T(F) = deg F − (T₁ + ⋯ + T_{rk F}). Because T is dominant, r ↦ T₁ + ⋯ + T_r is concave, so d_T(F + F′) + d_T(F ∩ F′) ≥ d_T(F) + d_T(F′) for saturated subbundles, exactly as for the ordinary degree. The canonical filtration is read off from the vertices of the concave envelope of the points (rk F, d_T(F)). Identify Arthur's indicator F^G(g, T) = 1 with T-semistability through maximal-parabolic flags.

*Remark.* The T-HN filtration is not the ordinary HN filtration with relabelled slopes: for O(1) ⊕ O(−1) on P¹ and T = (1, −1) the ordinary filtration is nontrivial while the T-filtration is trivial.

The API:

- `ShiftedHN.semistable` (data): The complete family of rank-r inequalities.
- `ShiftedHN.quotientSlope` (data): Use the consecutive T block determined by cumulative ranks.
- `ShiftedHN.filtration` (constructor): Canonical filtration with shifted semistable pieces and strictly decreasing shifted slopes.
- `ShiftedHN.arthurIndicator` (compatibility): Bundle inequalities agree with the adelic truncation indicator.

**Checks.**

- T=(c,…,c) recovers ordinary semistability and subtracts c from all slopes.
- For O(1)⊕O(−1) on P¹, T=(1,−1) makes the rank-one inequality 1−1≤0, so this unstable ordinary bundle is T-semistable.
- For n=3 and cumulative ranks 1,3, the second quotient subtracts (T₂+T₃)/2; reusing T₁ for each quotient is incorrect.

`Suggested.lean` gives the numerical shifted slope `shiftedSlope` and the P¹ example.

<a id="gs-0-parabolic-pgl2-instability"></a>

### GS.0.9 Parabolic PGL₂ instability

Define `ParabolicInstability`. Over an algebraically closed field define inst(E†)=min_D inst(E(D/2)), over reduced divisors D⊂Σ. A bundle is purely unstable when this minimum N is positive; then its minimizing D is unique, giving κ=(D,N). Order κ≤κ′ by N′−N≥|D−D′|. The corresponding κ-stratum is isomorphic, via E†↦E(D/2), to the ordinary instability-N PGL₂ stratum.

*Construction.* For a positive-instability rank-two bundle use its unique maximal line and compare push-outs/pull-backs at level points. Each reduced flag rotation changes ordinary instability by ±1. This proves uniqueness of the minimum when positive and reconstructs all flags. Use the inequalities for every D′ to define the bounded open, and identify the closed κ-stratum within it.

*Remark.* The reconstruction of all flags from the minimizing twist (YZ Lemma 3.19(2)) uses reduced divisors D′ ⊂ Σ only, not arbitrary effective divisors.

The API:

- `ParabolicInstability` (data): Minimum instability and a positive-minimum index κ.
- `ParabolicInstability.minimizer` (characterisation): The unique reduced D at a positive minimum.
- `ParabolicInstability.bounded` (data): The open defined by all fractional-twist inequalities.
- `ParabolicInstability.stratum` (equivalence): The κ-stratum and the ordinary N-stratum after the minimizing twist.

**Checks.**

- With Σ empty, the minimum is ordinary instability and D=0.
- For a purely unstable bundle, rotating one reduced extra flag changes instability by exactly one.
- On P¹ take E=Oe₁⊕Oe₂ with flags e₁ at 0 and e₂ at ∞. The twists for D=0 and D={0,∞} have underlying bundles O² and O(1)², both of instability zero; each single-point twist has type O(1)⊕O and instability one. Thus the zero minimum has two minimizers.

<a id="gs-0-automorphisms-and-the-central-lattice"></a>

### GS.0.10 Central lattices and finite quotients

Choose a central lattice `CentralLattice`: a discrete free subgroup Ξ of Z(F)\Z(A) whose central-degree map is injective and has finite-index image in the group of central degrees. The degree map pairs an idele with F-rational characters of G. In particular Ξ∩(Z(F)K_N/Z(F))={1}, so the lattice action introduces no extra degree-zero stabilizers. Central tensoring acts on bundles and shtukas. Bounded shtuka loci modulo Ξ have finitely many remaining degree components; rational stabilizer weights are retained. For GL_n, a nonzero-degree idele a gives the quotient by a^Z.

*Proof.* Use the idele-degree exact sequence to isolate the free central directions. Check the tensor action and level compatibility, then choose Ξ so the remaining central degrees form a finite set. Prove finite-type assertions for each HN bound after taking this quotient.

*Remark.* For GL_n tensoring by a line bundle of degree d changes degree by nd.

*Remark.* A nonzero-degree a suffices; do not require a rational point or a degree-one closed place.

The API: `CentralLattice.degree_injective` detects the identity in Ξ by its degree, `CentralLattice.finiteDegreeQuotient` gives the finite residual degree set, and `CentralLattice.tensor` supplies the action compatible with levels and modification chains.

**Checks.**

- For GL_n, a generator represented by a line bundle of degree d≠0 changes bundle degree by nd; the remaining degree classes are Z/(nd)Z.
- An idele of degree zero cannot generate a central lattice for GL₁: its powers leave infinitely many bundle degrees, and a nontrivial subgroup in degree zero also violates degree injectivity.
- For a semisimple group the central-degree group has rank zero and Ξ={1} is permitted; no artificial nonzero-degree generator is required.

### GS.0.11 Adelic orbit masses

Normalize vol(K)=1 for GL_n. The adelic orbit corresponding to E has mass 1/|Aut(E)|. In the diagonal kernel Σγ∈GL_n(F)1_K(g⁻¹γg), the value is |Aut(E)|; consequently its integral over a finite HN-truncated union counts bundle isomorphism classes without weights. General stack volumes remain weighted.

*Proof.* Compute the quotient measure of one K-orbit from its finite stabilizer. Identify the kernel summands with automorphisms and cancel this factor against the orbit mass.

*Remark.* For a line bundle the mass is 1/(q−1), whereas this diagonal-kernel contribution is 1.

*Remark.* A sum of constant functions on a groupoid gives weighted volume, not an unweighted object count.

### GS.0.12 Nonsplit bundle descent

For nonsplit G, choose a finite splitting extension and compatible integral model away from the bad places. Torsors with effective descent data recover 𝒢-bundles, and the rational groupoid decomposes into the pure-inner-form components indexed by ker¹(F,G). The component decomposition is preserved by spherical Hecke correspondences.

*Proof.* Use torsor descent for the model, distinguishing a group form from a torsor under it. Transport Hecke modifications and the no-leg identification on each generic torsor component. Show the operations do not change the generic ker¹ class.

*Remark.* A splitting-field choice must disappear from the resulting equivalence.

*Remark.* Do not replace the disjoint union of groupoids by a vector-space direct sum before taking functions.

### GS.0.13 Bundle and torsion mass identities

With vol(𝒞)=Σ[F]1/|Aut F|, for r≥1 and d∈Z one has vol(Bun_{r,d})=q^((g−1)(r²−1))|Pic⁰(F_q)|/(q−1)·∏_{i=2}^r Z_X(q^(−i)). The torsion series is Σ_{l≥0} vol(Coh_{0,l})s^l=∏_{i≥1}Z_X(q^(−i)s), equivalently the plethystic exponential Exp([X]s/(q−1)) with Adams operations using all extension-field point counts. The product for positive-rank coherent sheaves extends to i≥2 without the upper bound r.

*Proof.* Apply the Siegel mass formula for bundles with the specified stabilizer weighting. Factor torsion sheaves by closed-point support and sum local partition masses to obtain the Euler product. Stratify a coherent sheaf by its torsion subsheaf and vector-bundle quotient; the extension factor yields the final infinite product.

*Remark.* r=1 gives |Pic⁰(F_q)|/(q−1).

*Remark.* Rank zero is excluded from the bundle formula: Bun_{0,0} consists of the zero bundle with mass 1. For X=P¹ the positive-rank formula formally evaluated at r=0 would give q/(q−1), so it cannot be extended to this case.

*Remark.* The coefficient of s is #X(F_q)/(q−1); Exp here is not the ordinary exponential in this single number.

### GS.0.14 Cuspidal functions and bundle functions

Define `BunG.automorphicFunctions` and its cuspidal subspace. Transport the automorphic and constant-term spaces of FunctionFieldArithmetic FA.6 to finitely supported functions on the groupoid Bun_{𝒢,N}(F_q)/Ξ. A function is cuspidal when every proper-parabolic constant term vanishes, with the unipotent quotient measure normalized to total mass one. This target is the interface between the stack and the adelic description, inner-form components included; automorphic representation theory itself is FA.6's.

For a connected reductive G with a connected parahoric model, the finiteness of the support of cuspidal functions of fixed level modulo Ξ (Harder; recalled in VL §12.1, p. 151) is part of this target. FunctionFieldArithmetic FA.6 (*Harder support and central-degree finiteness*) proves it for split groups.

*Construction.* Pull the constant-term maps of FA.6 across the groupoid equivalence of [§GS.0.7 *Adelic bundle groupoids*](#gs-0-weil-uniformization). Retain stabilizer weights when the maps are written as sums of bundle correspondences. Use the compact-support theorem modulo the centre with the lattice Ξ.

*Remark.* The resulting fixed-level cusp space is finite-dimensional over E.

The API:

- `BunG.automorphicFunctions` (equivalence): Identify compactly supported functions on the bundle groupoid with the adelic functions of FA.6.
- `BunG.constantTerm` (compatibility): Transport each proper-parabolic constant term with its measure.
- `BunG.cuspLattice` (characterisation): Intersect cuspidal E-valued functions with the integral function lattice.

**Checks.**

- For a torus there are no proper parabolics, so all compactly supported functions modulo Ξ are cuspidal.
- For GL₂ the constant term along the upper triangular Borel subgroup averages a function over the compact quotient of the unipotent radical, of total mass one. The characteristic function of the trivial bundle O ⊕ O is finitely supported, but its constant term is nonzero at the split B-reduction (the split extension of O by O contributes), so it is not cuspidal: finite support does not imply cuspidality.
- The whole noncompact bundle-function space is not finite-dimensional before the cuspidality and central-quotient restrictions.

### GS.0.15 The Picard stack and rank-one Lang fibres

For G = G_m, Bun_{G_m} is the Picard stack: a G_m-gerbe over the Picard scheme Pic_X, with the scalar automorphisms of every line bundle retained. A rank-one shtuka with legs is a point of a fibre of the Lang map L = Frob_q − id. On the identity component Pic⁰ the Lang map is a finite étale isogeny with kernel Pic⁰(F_q); on the whole Picard scheme its kernel contains Pic(X)(F_q) and is infinite, and only after the quotient by the central lattice Ξ do finitely many degree components remain. Rank-one reciprocity itself, the identification of these Lang torsors with characters of the idele class group under the geometric-Frobenius normalization, is AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3, *Rank-one unramified reciprocity* and *Ramified rank-one curve reciprocity*; this target is the stack-level description that the horocycle computations of Layer GS.3 use.

*Proof.* Pass from line bundles to their Picard classes, keeping the scalar automorphisms. Apply Lang's theorem on the connected Jacobian Pic⁰ only, and keep the other degree components until the quotient by Ξ. Compare with the rank-one reciprocity of AL.3, recording the inversion from arithmetic to geometric Frobenius.

*Remark.* A product decomposition Pic × B G_m needs a chosen trivialization of the gerbe; no canonical product is asserted.

*Remark.* The infinite kernel of the Lang map on the whole Picard scheme must be visible: a statement that is only true on Pic⁰ fails this check.

### Examples

- *Rank one.* For G = G_m the bundle groupoid over F_q has the Picard group as its set of isomorphism classes and F_q^× as the automorphism group of every object; the stack mass of a single line bundle is 1/(q − 1), while the diagonal-kernel contribution of §GS.0.11 is 1 ([§GS.0.11 *Adelic orbit masses*](#gs-0-adelic-orbit-mass)).
- *The projective line.* On P¹ the rank-two bundles O(m) ⊕ O(−m) all have degree zero and instability 2m; they leave every bounded open of [§GS.0.6 *Bounded bundle loci*](#gs-0-harder-narasimhan-truncations). The bundle O(1) ⊕ O(−1) is unstable in the ordinary sense and T-semistable for T = (1, −1) ([§GS.0.8 *Shifted Harder–Narasimhan filtrations*](#gs-0-shifted-hn-filtration)).

## Layer GS.1: the Beilinson–Drinfeld Grassmannian and classical Satake

The Beilinson–Drinfeld Grassmannian, its Schubert supports and the bounded Hecke stacks come first; they use no sheaf theory and are the geometric input of everything later. Then come ℓ-adic sheaves on the stacks of finite type that occur in this roadmap, fusion, the Satake category with its corrected commutativity constraint, the geometric Satake equivalence over finite fields with ℓ-adic coefficients, the comparison with the classical spherical Satake isomorphism, nonsplit descent through the finite-form L-group, and the integral version that the modular theory of Layer GS.5 needs.

Standing hypotheses for this layer, in addition to those of Layer GS.0: ℓ ≠ p and E/Q_ℓ is a finite extension large enough for the representations in use, with integers O_E and uniformizer λ; half Tate twists use one fixed square root of q; integral and torsion statements replace E by O_E or O_E/λ^s explicitly. A level N ⊂ X is a finite closed subscheme with its nilpotents, and moving legs lie in U ∖ |N|. Whenever bounded geometry is asserted, a finite leg set I, an ordered partition of I and a representation or bound are fixed.

### GS.1.1 Beilinson–Drinfeld Grassmannians

Define `BDGrassmannian`. For a finite ordered partition I=I₁⊔⋯⊔Ik, Gr_I^(I₁,…,Ik) over X^I classifies bundles E₀,…,Ek, modifications E_{j−1}≃E_j away from the graphs indexed by Ij, and a trivialization of Ek. Beauville–Laszlo gluing identifies it with the same data on the formal discs. It is an ind-scheme, with factorization into products when the corresponding groups of legs are disjoint.

Beauville–Laszlo gluing for G-torsors along the graphs of the legs, deduced from the module statement through a faithful representation and the equations of the reduction to G, is part of this target.

*Construction.* Construct the modification functor and finite-dimensional lattice bounds using a faithful representation. Glue formal torsors with the trivial torsor off the graphs; verify independence from a formal coordinate. Use disjoint formal neighbourhoods for factorization and gluing of trivializations.

*Remark.* Its fibre over a closed point v is the local loop quotient LG/L⁺G of EndoscopicTransferAndUnitaryTraceComparison §3.2 (`LocalLoopGrassmannian`). This target adds the multi-leg geometry over X^I and its factorization.

- For I={1} and G=G_m, the geometric points of the fibre form the discrete set Z of lattice exponents; on nonreduced test rings the fibre is not the constant scheme Z.
- For GL₂ and coweight (1,0), the one-leg Schubert fibre is P¹.
- Two distinct legs give the product of local Grassmannians; on collision they give the convolution situation, so the disjoint-product formula is not asserted on the diagonal.

### GS.1.2 Schubert bounds

Define `SchubertBound`. For dominant coweights (ωi), the one-leg Schubert variety is the reduced closure of the positive-loop orbit t^ω. Over the disjoint-leg locus take their product and define Gr_{I,ω} as its reduced Zariski closure in the iterated BD Grassmannian. This differs in general from the larger representation-theoretic inequality bound Gr_{I,≲ω}; do not identify the two functors on nonreduced test rings without a theorem.

*Construction.* Construct local loop orbits and their reduced closed Schubert pieces. Use factorization on the disjoint locus and then reduced closure in a finite ambient bound. Show dominance order describes the geometric orbit strata; record what is asserted only for reduced subschemes.

*Remark.* Retain closure and inequality notation separately.

The API:

- `SchubertBound` (data): Dominant coweight tuple and reduced global closed support.
- `SchubertBound.orbit` (constructor): Open positive-loop orbit in the local Schubert variety.
- `SchubertBound.closure` (characterisation): Reduced closure of the disjoint product.
- `SchubertBound.jetAction` (compatibility): On any fixed bound the positive-loop action factors through sufficiently large finite jets.

**Checks.**

- ω=0 gives the unit section.
- For a torus each one-leg Schubert variety is a point; two colliding exponents add.
- For GL₂, (1,0) is minuscule and its orbit is already closed; a nonminuscule bound must include smaller strata.

### GS.1.3 Global Hecke chains

Define `GlobalHecke`. Hecke_I^(I₁,…,Ik) classifies the same modification chain without the final trivialization. On a fixed bound choose jets ni large enough that the loop action factors through G_{Σni xi}. The bounded Hecke stack is (Gr_bound×_{X^I}Bun_{G,Σni xi})/G_{Σni xi}; this gives its finite-dimensional local model and composition by gluing chains.

*Construction.* Use the final bundle’s finite-jet trivializations as a torsor. Identify the quotient with the modification moduli problem and establish the local model after smooth base change. Compose chains by forgetting intermediate bundles, keeping the leg partition.

*Remark.* No Satake theorem is needed for this construction.

The API:

- `GlobalHecke` (data): Bounded modification chains and all bundle projections.

### GS.1.4 ℓ-adic sheaves on stacks of finite type

Define `StackSheaf.constructible`. For an algebraic stack 𝒳 locally of finite type over k (a finite field or an algebraic closure of one), with ℓ invertible, and Λ one of O_E/λ^s, O_E or E, define the constructible derived category D_c(𝒳, Λ) on the lisse-étale site, with the operations f^∗, Rf_∗, Rf_!, Rf^!, ⊗ and RHom, the dualizing complex and Verdier duality, and the perverse t-structure with its intermediate extensions. Prove smooth and arbitrary base change for Rf_!, the projection formula, the Künneth formula and the fundamental triangle for an open–closed decomposition; on a Deligne–Mumford stack the étale site gives the same categories, and on a quotient [Y/H] by a smooth affine group H they are the H-equivariant categories of Y. Over F_q, prove the Grothendieck–Lefschetz trace formula for stacks of finite type: for a stratifiable, ι-mixed, convergent complex K₀ bounded above (Sun's class), the sum over the F_{q^v}-points, each weighted by the inverse order of its automorphism group, of the traces of Frobenius on stalks equals the absolutely convergent alternating trace of Frobenius on RΓ_c, and Rf_! preserves convergent complexes with the relative version of the formula. These are exactly the operations the shtuka stacks, Hecke stacks and their quotients by Ξ and by finite jet groups need; EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheaves and EtaleCohomologyFoundations state them for schemes.

The morphism f:𝒳→𝒴 is of finite type for the pushforward and extraordinary-operation statements. The domains are those of LO-I and LO-II: Rf_∗:D^+_c→D^+_c, Rf_!:D^−_c→D^−_c, f^∗ and Rf^! on D_c, RHom:(D^−_c)^op×D^+_c→D^+_c, and derived tensor D^−_c×D^−_c→D^−_c. The projection, base-change and Künneth comparisons use these domains, with the factors bounded above in the Künneth formula. Unbounded D_c retains the duality and gluing constructions; this does not assert that every operation is an endofunctor on all of D_c.

*Remark.* On a scheme these categories and operations restrict to those of EtaleCohomologyFoundations and EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheaves.

*Remark.* Rf_∗ and Rf_! need not preserve boundedness on stacks: the cohomology of B G_m is a polynomial ring Q_ℓ[c] with c in degree 2.

The API:

- `StackSheaf.constructible` (data): The constructible derived category D_c(𝒳, Λ) on the lisse-étale site, with its full subcategories D^b_c and D^±_c.
- `StackSheaf.pullback` (functoriality): f^∗ and Rf^!, with identity and composition isomorphisms.
- `StackSheaf.pushforward` (functoriality): Rf_∗ and Rf_!, with the forget-supports map Rf_! → Rf_∗ and the projection formula.
- `StackSheaf.baseChange` (compatibility): For a cartesian square, b^∗ Rf_! ≅ Rf′_! a^∗.
- `StackSheaf.kunneth` (compatibility): Rf_! of an external tensor product is the external product of the Rf_!.
- `StackSheaf.duality` (structure): The dualizing complex Ω_𝒳 and D = RHom(−, Ω_𝒳), with biduality on D^b_c.
- `StackSheaf.perverse` (structure): The perverse t-structure glued from a smooth atlas, its heart, intermediate extension and simple objects.
- `StackSheaf.etaleComparison` (compatibility): On a Deligne–Mumford stack the étale and lisse-étale theories agree; on a scheme they are the scheme theory.
- `StackSheaf.traceFormula` (relation): For 𝒳₀ of finite type over F_q and K₀ bounded above, stratifiable, ι-mixed and convergent, the weighted point sum equals the convergent alternating trace of Frobenius on RΓ_c, with the relative version for Rf_!.

**Checks.**

- For a separated scheme of finite type the operations agree with the scheme operations of EtaleCohomologyFoundations; in particular Rf_! for an open immersion is extension by zero.
- For 𝒳 = B G_m over F̄_q, H^∗(𝒳, Q_ℓ) = Q_ℓ[c] with c in degree 2, so RΓ of the constant sheaf is not bounded; a theory restricted to D^b_c cannot contain it.
- For a finite constant group Γ over F_q, the Γ-torsors over F_q correspond to the conjugacy classes c of Γ, with automorphism groups the centralizers Z(c), so the weighted point count of B Γ is Σ_c 1/|Z(c)| = Σ_c |c|/|Γ| = 1; this equals the Frobenius trace on H^∗_c(B Γ, Q_ℓ), which is Q_ℓ in degree 0.
- For B G_m over F_q the weighted point count is 1/(q − 1) = Σ_{i ≥ 1} q^{−i}, matching the convergent alternating trace of Frobenius on H^∗_c(B G_m), which is Q_ℓ(i) in degree −2i for i ≥ 1.

### GS.1.5 Fusion smallness and convolution

For globally moving legs, the proper map forgetting intermediate bounded modifications is small and is an isomorphism over distinct legs. Its restriction to the full collision diagonal is semismall, not generally small. Consequently proper pushforward identifies the relevant global IC objects, and convolution on the diagonal preserves perversity.

*Proof.* Stratify X^I by collisions. Over the open stratum forgetting is an isomorphism. Reduce each collision block to local convolution, whose fibre dimensions are bounded by semismall Bott–Samelson geometry. The codimension of each non-open collision stratum supplies the strict inequality globally. Apply the small-map IC theorem.

*Remark.* For GL₂ two standard minuscule modifications, the collision fibre over the central coweight (1,1) is P¹; the local map is semismall with equality.

*Remark.* Do not infer local smallness by restricting global smallness to the diagonal.

### GS.1.6 Minuscule Hecke geometry at Iwahori level

Define `IwahoriHecke`. For μ∈{±1}^r, Hk_n^μ(Σ) consists of Iwahori bundles E₀,…,Er and legs xi, with E_{i−1}→Ei for μi=1 (the reverse for −1) an injection with invertible cokernel on Γxi preserving every flag step. Legs may meet Σ. Every bundle projection is smooth of relative dimension rn; the bundle-and-leg projection is flat of relative dimension r(n−1), smooth over (X−Σ)^r. Quotient by simultaneous Picard tensoring gives the PGL_n version.

*Construction.* Reduce to one modification and a single level point. Write compatible lines in the projectivizations of the periodic lattice chain; in an étale chart the equation is a product of selected coordinates equal to the leg coordinate t. This equation proves flatness, while forgetting t gives smoothness; off Σ recover a projective bundle. Descend through the Picard action.

*Remark.* At a level point flatness does not imply smoothness over the leg base.

**Checks.**

- r=0 gives Bun_n(Σ).
- One GL₂ leg off Σ has fibre P¹ over its bundle and leg.
- At a nodal GL₂ level chart ab=t, the t=0 fibre is singular although the total chart A² and bundle projection are smooth.

<a id="gs-1-classical-satake-category"></a>

### GS.1.7 The classical Satake category

Define `ClassicalSatake`. For split connected reductive G and coefficient field E of characteristic zero with ℓ≠p, Sat_G is the category of positive-loop-equivariant perverse E-sheaves on Gr_G over F̄_q with finite-dimensional closed support. Convolution uses the twisted product and proper multiplication; the unit is the skyscraper at the unit coset. Total cohomology is the fibre functor after the modified commutativity convention. Finite-field Satake coefficient sheaves carry the specified normalized descent datum; arbitrary Frobenius structures are additional data, treated by the arithmetic Satake category of §GS.1.13.

*Construction.* Define equivariance through finite jets on each support. Descend the exterior product to the twisted product and push it along multiplication. Use semismallness for perversity and fusion for associativity; retain the coefficient-field restriction for semisimplicity.

*Remark.* With coefficients of characteristic ℓ the category is not semisimple; this layer uses positive-characteristic coefficients only through the integral version [§GS.1.14 *Integral geometric Satake*](#gs-1-integral-geometric-satake).

The API:

- `ClassicalSatake` (data): Finite-support positive-loop-equivariant perverse sheaves.
- `ClassicalSatake.convolution` (structure): Monoidal convolution with unit and associator.
- `ClassicalSatake.fibre` (functoriality): Total cohomology with finite-dimensional E-values.
- `ClassicalSatake.simple` (characterisation): Simple objects are IC closures indexed by dominant coweights.

**Checks.**

- For G_m, convolution of delta_m and delta_n is delta_{m+n}.
- The unit IC_0 convolves identically on either side.
- For GL₂, standard⊗standard has symmetric-square and determinant summands; convolution cannot be defined as pointwise tensor product on the same support.
- For G=1 the geometric category is finite-dimensional E-vector spaces. Over F_q the one-dimensional sheaves with Frobenius +1 and −1 are distinct, although their geometric fibres agree; the entire arithmetic category cannot be identified with Rep_E(1).

### GS.1.8 Satake signs and Tate normalization

Correct the geometric fusion commutativity by an extra minus sign when both objects lie on odd-dimensional components. Then total cohomology has the ordinary symmetric tensor constraint. With a fixed square root of q, normalize IC by the relative dimension shift and half Tate twist, so the spherical trace convention matches normalized Satake.

*Proof.* Fusion gives the super commutativity on total cohomology. Grade connected components by orbit-dimension parity and remove the super sign on odd-odd exchanges. Track the dimension shift and chosen square-root Tate twist in the function-sheaf dictionary.

*Remark.* For a torus all orbit dimensions are zero.

*Remark.* For the GL₂ standard minuscule P¹ support, odd-odd exchange needs the extra sign.

### GS.1.9 Classical geometric Satake

The corrected symmetric tensor category Sat_G with its total-cohomology fibre functor is equivalent to Rep_E(Ĝ), where Ĝ has the dual based root datum. A chosen Borel and pinning identify the reconstructed group with the chosen dual group. For moving legs this yields ULA coefficient sheaves S_{I,W}, functorial in W, compatible with disjoint factorization, convolution, all coalescence maps and relative IC normalization.

*Proof.* The semi-infinite orbits give weight functors: compactly supported cohomology along them is concentrated in degree ⟨2ρ, ν⟩, and their sum is an exact faithful tensor fibre functor. Reconstruct the Tannakian group from the coendomorphism coalgebra of this fibre functor (MV §11) and identify its torus and root datum through the weight functors and restriction to rank-one Levi subgroups (MV §12). Over a finite field with ℓ-adic coefficients the equivalence is Richarz's theorem: over a separably closed field (Ric, Theorem 0.1) and, after Galois descent, over any field with the full L-group (Ric, Theorem 5.1). The relative version over X^I — ULA Satake sheaves that are perverse on every geometric fibre after the shift by dim X^I, with fusion and coalescence — is part of this target. Globalize by descent along the torsor of formal coordinates and by Beilinson–Drinfeld fusion; VL Theorem 1.17 states the multi-leg compatibilities used later.

*Remark.* For a torus obtain the dual torus and its coweight grading.

*Remark.* For GL₂ the minuscule IC gives the standard dual representation and associativity agrees under triple fusion.

### GS.1.10 Central action on Satake sheaves

The positive-loop action of the centre on the bounded Grassmannian and its Satake sheaves is trivial in the descent needed for the central quotient of shtukas; central tensoring of the bundle factor therefore preserves the coefficient sheaf.

*Proof.* A central positive loop changes a trivialization by an automorphism extending across the disc. Check equivariant descent on each finite jet quotient and then transport it to Hecke and shtuka coefficients.

*Remark.* Distinguish this geometric central-loop action from the possibly nontrivial action of Z(Ĝ) on a representation.

### GS.1.11 Normalized spherical Satake

At a good place v∈U∖|N| with hyperspecial model, normalize vol(G(O_v)) = 1. The classical Satake isomorphism of SmoothRepresentationsOfLocalGroups §SR.4.1, with a fixed square root of q, identifies the spherical E-Hecke algebra with E ⊗_Z K₀(Rep Ĝ); for a torus it is the group algebra of the cocharacter lattice. For irreducible V of highest weight ω, let h_{V,v} be the image of [V]. It takes values in O_E, the h_{V,v} form an O_E-basis of the integral spherical Hecke algebra, and h_{V,v} = (−1)^{⟨2ρ,ω⟩} Tr(Frob_v, S_V), with the half Tate twist already fixed. For nonminuscule V the trace of the intersection complex is not the characteristic function of a single double coset.

*Proof.* Take the classical Satake isomorphism from SR.4.1, and identify the traces by the sheaf–function dictionary and the compatibility of geometric Satake with convolution. Evaluate the normalized IC traces on local double cosets and compare the triangular bases in dominance order.

*Remark.* h_1 is the unit 1_{G(Ov)}.

*Remark.* For G_m the basis is δ_{π^m} and multiplication adds m.

### GS.1.12 Determinant lines and opposition signs

On the equal-characteristic GL_n locus Λ⊂R[[t]]ⁿ with locally free rank-N quotient, define `satakeDeterminantLine` by applying the determinant functor of AlgebraicVectorBundles to this quotient: its fibre is ∧^N_R(R[[t]]ⁿ/Λ). Its API comprises `satakeDeterminantLine.baseChange`, compatibility with pullback of the quotient, and `satakeDeterminantLine.chain`, the determinant isomorphism for the short exact sequence of quotients of a lattice chain. In the simply connected semisimple complex setting of Lusztig–Yun, the normalized opposition anti-involution acts on unshifted IH^{2j}(Gr≤λ) by (−1)^j. This is the equal-characteristic input to their numerical identity used by Zhu; the mixed-characteristic Satake theorem belongs to GeometricSatakeAndFusion.

*Proof.* Use the actual finite locally free R-module quotient for the determinant line; its determinant is compatible with families and modification chains. Identify opposition as a monoidal automorphism under equal-characteristic Satake and compute its torus element (−1)^ρ. Normalize by the identity on the open orbit and translate the 2ρ grading to the sign (−1)^j on unshifted intersection cohomology.

**Checks.**

- For Λ=R[[t]]ⁿ, N=0 and the determinant line is canonically R.
- For Λ=tR[[t]]e₁⊕⊕_{i>1}R[[t]]e_i, the quotient is Re₁ and scaling e₁ by a unit a acts on the line by a, rather than a⁻¹. This fixes determinant versus inverse determinant.
- For Λ=tR[[t]]², swapping the two quotient basis vectors acts by −1 on ∧²R². Over a ring of characteristic two it acts by +1, as required by the same determinant formula.
- For unshifted IH⁰ and IH² the normalized opposition signs are respectively +1 and −1; shifting the grading before applying this formula fails the second value.

### GS.1.13 Nonsplit Satake descent

Over the open where G is reductive, descend split Satake from a finite splitting cover with its pinned finite Galois action on Ĝ. The resulting coefficient functor is indexed by algebraic representations of the finite-form L-group Ĝ⋊Q and is compatible with restriction of the prescribed Γ→Q projection. Geometric and algebraic actions differ by the Tate/pinning normalization and must be compared explicitly.

The comparison between the geometric Galois action on Ĝ obtained by Tannakian descent and the algebraic action through a pinning is Ric, Proposition 5.6, p. 22: the geometric action of γ is the algebraic action composed with the inner automorphism Ad ρ(cycl(γ)), where cycl is the ℓ-adic cyclotomic character and ρ, the half-sum of positive coroots of Ĝ, is viewed as a cocharacter of Ĝ_ad; Ric, Corollary 5.8, turns this into an isomorphism of the two L-groups. This twist is the Tate normalization fixed above.

*Proof.* Construct the pinned action and its descent datum on split Satake sheaves. Check cocycle and independence of the splitting cover, then descend fusion and convolution. Keep the action on coefficients distinct from the Weil action on the base.

*Remark.* A split group has trivial Q action.

*Remark.* For a nonsplit torus the dual-character lattice carries the actual Galois action.

### GS.1.14 Integral geometric Satake

For the split equal-characteristic affine Grassmannian over F̄_q, geometric Satake over O_E identifies representations of the pinned dual group on finitely generated O_E-modules with the integral Satake category, compatibly with weight functors, fusion and extension to E. Its restriction identifies finite free representations with the flat Satake objects. Convolution for general coefficients uses zeroth perverse cohomology of the derived exterior product before descent and proper pushforward; for flat objects this truncation is unnecessary. On the moving-leg Grassmannian construct the fully faithful coefficient functor Sat^{O_E}_{G,I} on all finitely generated coefficient representations, including torsion, with the specified finite-field descent, as in Xue-I Theorem 1.1.5. The API `IntegralSatake.coefficient`, `IntegralSatake.fusion`, `IntegralSatake.flat_iff_finiteFree` and `IntegralSatake.extendToE` records the coefficient functor, fusion, the flat subcategory and rationalization. The construction uses the standard integral perverse t-structure; Verdier duality need not preserve that heart. Invariant vectors and covectors give integral creation and annihilation by functoriality. No semisimplicity is asserted over O_E or its residue field.

*Proof.* Use the integral weight-functor reconstruction and the same pinned root datum as the rational theorem. Extend from finite free coefficients to finitely generated coefficients by presentations and the right-exact perverse tensor product, preserving the fusion comparisons. Use the standard integral perversity, without invoking preservation by Verdier duality (EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheaves §§2.3–2.5, the integral perversity and its dual). Transferring MV's integral reconstruction, proved for the complex topology, to étale O_E-sheaves on the equal-characteristic Grassmannian over F̄_q is part of this target; Xue-I §§1.1.1–1.1.7 specify its moving-leg coefficient functor.

*Remark.* Extension of scalars to E recovers [§GS.1.9 *Classical geometric Satake*](#gs-1-geometric-satake-functor).

*Remark.* Reduction modulo λ need not preserve semisimplicity or diagonalizability of the Hecke action.

**Checks.**

- At the unit point the representation O_E/λ gives the torsion skyscraper O_E/λ, so the coefficient functor is not confined to free modules.
- The derived tensor of two copies of O_E/λ at the unit has nonzero Tor₁ in degree −1; its zeroth perverse cohomology is O_E/λ, the ordinary coefficient tensor product. Omitting the perverse truncation fails this test.
- For G_m, convolution of a weight-m object with coefficient M and a weight-n object with coefficient M′ has weight m+n and coefficient M⊗_{O_E}M′; for M=M′=O_E it agrees with the flat convolution and rationalizes to the E-valued rule.

### Examples

- *Tori.* For G = G_m the one-leg Grassmannian has the discrete set Z of geometric points, every Schubert variety is a point, convolution adds coweights, and the Satake category is the category of Z-graded vector spaces, matching Rep(G_m) = Rep(Ĝ).
- *GL₂, minuscule.* For the coweight (1, 0) the Schubert variety is P¹, already closed; its normalized intersection complex goes to the standard representation of GL₂ = Ĝ. The convolution of two copies decomposes as the symmetric square plus the determinant, and the collision fibre of the two-step chain over the central coweight (1, 1) is P¹, which shows the semismall equality case in [§GS.1.5 *Fusion smallness and convolution*](#gs-1-forgetting-intermediate-modifications-is-small).
- *Signs.* On the P¹ support of the GL₂ minuscule sheaf, cohomology sits in odd shifted degrees, so the fusion commutativity must be corrected by a sign before the fibre functor is symmetric ([§GS.1.8 *Satake signs and Tate normalization*](#gs-1-modified-commutativity-and-tate-twist)); for tori no correction is needed.

## Layer GS.2: global shtukas and their cohomology

This layer constructs the stacks of shtukas as Hecke stacks pulled back along the graph of Frobenius, their finite-type truncations and smooth local models, and the compactly supported cohomology sheaves over the leg base in every degree. The bound on the source and on the target of every partial Frobenius and Hecke map is kept visible: these maps can enlarge a Harder–Narasimhan bound, so they act on the directed system of truncations, never on one fixed truncation. The fractional-infinity shtukas of Yun–Zhang and the PGL₂ horocycle geometry are specified specializations with their own degree and parity conditions. Standing hypotheses are those of Layer GS.1.

<a id="gs-2-global-shtuka-stack"></a>

### GS.2.1 Global shtukas

Define `GlobalShtuka`. For legs in U∖|N|, where U is the reductive open of the chosen model, and an ordered partition of I, Cht_{N,I,W} classifies bundles E₀,…,Ek with compatible full levels, bounded modifications E_{j−1}≃Ej away from the legs in Ij, and a level-preserving isomorphism Ek≃τE₀, where τ=(id_X×Frob_S)∗. It is the Hecke correspondence pulled back along the Frobenius graph of Bun_{G,N}. The W-support is pulled back from the reduced global Schubert support.

*Construction.* Form the stack fibre product, using actual isomorphisms at its two endpoints. Pull back the bounded Grassmannian support along the local-model map. Check the determinant/Kottwitz condition for nonemptiness: the total modification class must vanish when the closing twist has degree zero.

*Remark.* For split G, admissibility is Σ[ωi]=0 in π₁(G), equivalently the diagonal dual centre acts trivially on the tensor representation.

The API:

- `GlobalShtuka` (data): The bundles, levels, modifications, legs and closing Frobenius isomorphism.
- `GlobalShtuka.legs` (projection): The morphism to U^I.
- `GlobalShtuka.heckeForget` (functoriality): Forget the closing isomorphism.
- `GlobalShtuka.bound` (characterisation): Fibre product with the specified reduced Schubert support.

**Checks.**

- For G_m with two legs of coweights 1,−1, degrees balance; a single coweight 1 without infinity twist has empty moduli.
- A zero modification gives a Frobenius-periodic bundle with compatible level.
- Frobenius acts on S in τE; replacing it by absolute Frobenius on X changes the moduli problem.

### GS.2.2 Finite-type shtuka truncations

For a fixed W, HN bound μ and central lattice Ξ, Cht^{≤μ}_{N,I,W}/Ξ is a finite-type Deligne–Mumford stack in the source’s bounded setting. For sufficiently deep nonempty N, depending on μ and W, its components are quasi-projective schemes. With N empty the quotient-of-quasi-projective assertion holds over U^I for every open U⊊X; do not claim the entire unbounded shtuka stack is a scheme.

*Proof.* Intersect the bounded Hecke locus with the Frobenius graph and use the HN bound for finite type. Frobenius-fixed infinitesimal automorphisms vanish, giving the unramified diagonal. Increase the level enough to kill the remaining finite automorphisms uniformly on the fixed bound.

*Remark.* The depth needed may increase with μ and W.

*Remark.* A single bounded open need not be preserved by all Hecke or partial Frobenius operations.

<a id="gs-2-local-model-map-and-smoothness"></a>

### GS.2.3 Smooth shtuka local models

For sufficiently large finite jets ni on the fixed Schubert support, the bounded iterated shtuka stack maps smoothly to Gr_{I,W}/G_{Σ n_i x_i}, of relative dimension (Σni)dim G in the split constant-model setting. Thus singularities are governed by the Schubert local model, with the perverse shift determined by this relative dimension.

*Proof.* Present the fibre as an equalizer of two maps between smooth bundle-with-level stacks. One map forgets some jet level and is smooth; the other factors through relative Frobenius and has zero differential along the fibres. The equalizer is smooth of the claimed relative dimension, independently of the singularities of the Schubert support.

*Remark.* The theorem is about a smooth map to a possibly singular quotient of a Schubert variety, not smoothness of every shtuka stack.

*Remark.* A minuscule local model, which is smooth, gives a smooth source.

<a id="gs-2-fractional-infinity-shtukas"></a>

### GS.2.4 Fractional-infinity shtukas

Define `TwistedShtuka`. For Iwahori bundles and μ∈{±1}^r choose D∞ supported on residue-field sections at infinity, with coefficients in (1/n)Z and Σμi=n deg D∞. Require Er≃(τE₀)(D∞), with Frobenius applied before fractional twisting. Form the Frobenius-graph fibre product with AL(−D∞)∘p_r; quotient by Pic_X(F_q) to obtain PGL_n shtukas. The leg map is to X^r×S∞ and includes level collisions.

*Construction.* Construct the twisted graph fibre product and take degrees to prove the balance condition. Redistribute the coefficients by a Frobenius coboundary, compare with ordinary extra legs at infinity, and descend through Pic_X(F_q). Use the minuscule local model for smoothness of the total stacks and flatness of the leg map, with the ramified leg base change of YZ §3.2. For PGL₂ use sign independence and the standard half divisor to obtain the parity r ≡ #Σ_∞ mod 2. Fractional rotations give commuting Atkin–Lehner involutions.

*Remark.* The standard parity counts closed infinity places, not their total degree.

The API:

- `TwistedShtuka` (data): Signed chain, residue sections, degree balance and twisted Frobenius closure.
- `TwistedShtuka.pgl` (equivalence): The Pic_X(F_q) quotient and its twisted-graph description.
- `TwistedShtuka.redistribute` (compatibility): Change infinity coefficients by the source’s Frobenius-coboundary rule.
- `TwistedShtuka.atkinLehner` (functoriality): Commuting fractional rotations, involutive for PGL₂.

**Checks.**

- D∞=0 forces Σμi=0 for GL_n.
- For n=2, one infinity place of degree two still requires odd r in the standard construction.
- With r=1, μ=−1 and D∞=−Γ∞/n the balance is −1=−1; this is the independent Drinfeld-module specialization.

<a id="gs-2-cohomology-sheaves-of-shtuka-stacks"></a>

### GS.2.5 Shtuka intersection-cohomology systems

Define `ShtukaIC` and `ShtukaCohomology.trunc`. Pull the Satake sheaf through the smooth local model, descend by Ξ, and normalize perversely relative to U^I. For the leg map p define H^{j,≤μ}_{N,I,W}=R^jp_!F_{N,I,W}^{≤μ} for every j∈Z, and H^j_{N,I,W}=colim_μ H^{j,≤μ}; the original excursion construction uses j=0. At each finite bound the sheaves are constructible; the colimit is an ind-constructible system, not a single constructible sheaf. Proper partition pushforward identifies different iterated presentations.

*Construction.* Form the coefficients at each bound by descent along an atlas ([§GS.1.4 *ℓ-adic sheaves on stacks of finite type*](#gs-1-l-adic-sheaves-on-stacks)) and use base change for f_!; no properness of the leg map is assumed. For inclusions of HN opens use extension by zero and the covariant map on compact support. Take the filtered system, and prove independence of the partition by proper pushforward of Satake sheaves.

*Remark.* The degree-zero normalization relative to the leg base must agree with the space of functions in the case of no legs.

The API:

- `ShtukaIC` (data): The relative-perverse coefficient sheaf on each bounded stack.
- `ShtukaCohomology.trunc` (data): The constructible R^jp_! object at μ for each fixed j; j=0 gives the original excursion system.
- `ShtukaCohomology.transition` (functoriality): Covariant maps as HN opens grow.
- `ShtukaCohomology.partition` (equivalence): Canonical comparison of iterated presentations, compatible with a third refinement.

**Checks.**

- For I=∅, W=1, degree-zero compact support gives functions on the rational bundle groupoid modulo Ξ.
- At a fixed bound the sheaf is constructible; the whole unbounded colimit is not declared constructible.
- Refining a partition twice gives the same comparison as refining once; an arbitrary isomorphism per partition is insufficient.

<a id="gs-2-zero-leg-twisted-inner-forms"></a>

### GS.2.6 Twisted zero-leg inner forms

With r=0 and balanced infinity coefficients, the geometric zero-leg GL_n twisted-shtuka groupoid at a fixed ξ∈S∞ is [B×(F)\B×(A)/∏Kx]. Here B is the degree-n central simple algebra split off Σ∞ with inv_x(B)=Σ_i c_x^(i), and Kx are the source’s minimal parahorics at Σ and maximal parahorics elsewhere. The reciprocity sum of invariants is zero. This is a separate twisted specialization of adelic descent.

*Proof.* Construct B from the local invariants and the global Brauer exact sequence. Classify the Frobenius-periodic twisted bundles by the inner form B and compare parahoric stabilizers. YZ state this case without proof (§3.2.2); the classification of the Frobenius-periodic twisted bundles and the comparison of minimal and maximal parahoric stabilizers are part of this target. Abelian reciprocity alone does not give them.

*Remark.* Σ_∞ = ∅ and zero twist recover the split GL_n adelic groupoid.

*Remark.* This is an equivalence of groupoids; automorphism groups are not discarded.

### GS.2.7 Elliptic sheaves as a specialization

Take the elliptic sheaves of DrinfeldModulesAndTModules DM.7 and compare their periodic bundle chains with the one-leg, negative-modification, fractional-infinity shtukas of [§GS.2.4 *Fractional-infinity shtukas*](#gs-2-fractional-infinity-shtukas), under the infinity and level conditions of YZ §3.2. This comparison is independent of the multi-leg constructions and is not used to define Bun_G or general shtukas.

*Proof.* Write the elliptic-sheaf periodicity as a fractional twist of an Iwahori chain. Compare its Frobenius map and one-leg modification with the twisted closing equation, preserving level.

*Remark.* Degree balance and the pole at infinity agree on both sides.

*Remark.* Layers GS.3–GS.5 do not use elliptic sheaves.

<a id="gs-2-pgl2-horocycle-indices"></a>

### GS.2.8 PGL₂ horocycles

Define `HorocycleIndex`. A horocycle index is κ=(κ₀,…,κr), κi=(Di,Ni), with |Di−Di−1|+|Ni−Ni−1|=1, Nr=N₀, and Dr differing from Fr(D₀) at exactly one geometric point over each closed place of Σ∞. The κ-horocycle fixes these positive-instability indices in the standard PGL₂ shtuka. I(κ)={i:Ni≠Ni−1} has even size; the leg support X(κ) fixes all other leg coordinates and the infinity sections, so X(κ)≃X^{I(κ)}.

*Construction.* Analyze the three one-step cases: N rises, N falls, or D toggles at the level point while N is constant. Impose Frobenius closure to obtain the endpoint condition. Define the horocycle and bounded open, factor the leg map through X(κ), and identify support classes under simultaneous rational-level divisor toggles.

*Remark.* The abstract directed index set allows integer Ni, but geometric purely unstable strata require Ni>0.

The API:

- `HorocycleIndex` (data): All adjacency and twisted-Frobenius endpoint constraints.
- `HorocycleIndex.support` (data): The coordinate subscheme X(κ) and free coordinates I(κ).
- `Horocycle.stratum` (constructor): The locally closed substack fixing intermediate indices.
- `Horocycle.truncation` (functoriality): Componentwise ordered bounded opens covering the stack.

**Checks.**

- A constant-N step must toggle a single level flag, and its leg is forced to that level point.
- A rising-N step has unchanged D and a free leg; a falling step reverses the corresponding modification.
- Nr=N₀ forces equally many rising and falling steps, so #I(κ) is even.

<a id="gs-2-partial-frobenius-morphisms"></a>

### GS.2.9 Partial Frobenius

Define `Shtuka.partialFrobenius`. Rotate the first block of an iterated shtuka chain to the end after Frobenius pullback. This gives the partial Frobenius over Frob_{I₁}:U^I→U^I, inducing invertible commuting operators after passage to the cohomological HN colimit. Their product is the canonical total Frobenius. A fixed truncation may map only into a larger bound.

*Construction.* Cut off the first modification block and reglue it using the closing Frobenius isomorphism. Use universal-homeomorphism invariance of étale coefficients and partition independence to obtain the cohomological maps. Check commuting rotations on common refinements and bound growth, then pass to the filtered colimit.

*Remark.* The definition does not assume that a chosen finite bound μ is stable.

The API:

- `Shtuka.partialFrobenius` (functoriality): Rotate a specified leg block and move those legs by Frobenius.
- `Shtuka.partialFrobenius.cohomology` (compatibility): Induce the coefficient isomorphism and colimit operator.
- `Shtuka.partialFrobenius.product` (relation): The product over a partition is total Frobenius.

**Checks.**

- For one leg the operator is total Frobenius.
- For two disjoint blocks the two orders agree after partition comparison.
- A closed point of degree d returns to its geometric component after d iterates; using one iterate universally gives the wrong local Hecke relation.

### GS.2.10 Coalescence of legs

For ζ:I→J and the diagonal ∆ζ:U^J→U^I, pullback of the cohomology system with coefficient W identifies with the system for W^ζ, restriction along Ĝ^J→Ĝ^I. The comparisons are natural in W and compose coherently for I→J→K. They include noninjective ζ and the creation/removal of trivial legs.

*Proof.* Pull back the Satake fusion isomorphism through the local-model diagram. Use f_! base change and compare cofinal HN systems. Check the associativity diagram on sheaves before taking generic fibres.

*Remark.* All maps I→J are handled, including a surjection merging two legs.

<a id="gs-2-hecke-correspondences-on-shtuka-stacks"></a>

### GS.2.11 Hecke correspondences on shtukas

A compactly supported bi-K_N-invariant integral Hecke function defines a cohomological correspondence on the shtuka stacks, supported on its finite modification locus. Its action on the HN colimits commutes with partial Frobenius, coefficient maps and coalescence. The action can increase the HN bound; its extension across a place v is the operator S_{V,v} of [§GS.3.6 *Hecke operators from Frobenius*](#gs-3-hecke-operator-as-creation-frobenius-annihilation).

*Construction.* Construct bounded-support Hecke diagrams preserving Frobenius and level. Check properness/étaleness needed for pull-push and compose via common refinements. Use the creation–Frobenius–annihilation formula to extend spherical operators across their support.

*Remark.* The action is on the HN system, not on an arbitrarily fixed finite bound.

The API:

- `ShtukaHecke.correspondence` (constructor): The bounded-support diagram with its coefficient morphism.
- `ShtukaHecke.act` (functoriality): Integral Hecke action on the cohomology colimit.
- `ShtukaHecke.convolution` (compatibility): Convolution agrees with composition of correspondences.

**Checks.**

- The identity double coset acts as the identity.
- Disjoint-place correspondences commute.
- The adjoint under compact-support duality is the inverse-double-coset correspondence with the chosen measure normalization.

### Examples

- *No legs.* With I = ∅ and W = 1 a shtuka is a bundle with level and an isomorphism with its Frobenius pullback; by Lang's theorem these are the F_q-points of Bun_{G,N}, so the degree-zero compactly supported cohomology is the space of finitely supported functions on Bun_{G,N}(F_q)/Ξ ([§GS.2.5 *Shtuka intersection-cohomology systems*](#gs-2-cohomology-sheaves-of-shtuka-stacks)).
- *Degree balance for G_m.* With two legs of coweights 1 and −1 the degrees balance; a single leg of coweight 1 and no infinity twist gives the empty stack, because deg τE = deg E ([§GS.2.1 *Global shtukas*](#gs-2-global-shtuka-stack)). With fractional infinity, r = 1, μ = −1 and D_∞ = −Γ_∞/n balances, which is the Drinfeld-module case ([§GS.2.4 *Fractional-infinity shtukas*](#gs-2-fractional-infinity-shtukas)).
- *Partial Frobenius at a degree-d point.* A closed point of degree d returns to its geometric component only after d iterates of the partial Frobenius, which is why the Eichler–Shimura relation of Layer GS.3 uses Frob^{deg v}.

## Layer GS.3: Hecke finiteness and cohomological control

Creation and annihilation of legs produce the operators S_{V,v}; the alternating-tensor proof of the Eichler–Shimura relation for them comes before their identification with Hecke operators. Integral Hecke finiteness, with its finite O_E-witnesses, singles out the part of cohomology on which the original Galois construction works. Xue's theorems — integral finiteness of cuspidal cohomology and finiteness of the full cohomology over one local Hecke algebra — control the full cohomology. For PGL₂ with fractional infinity, the ind-perverse boundary analysis and the Eisenstein spectral decomposition of Yun–Zhang are additional targets, with the corrected shifts. Standing hypotheses are those of Layer GS.1.

<a id="gs-3-creation-and-annihilation-morphisms"></a>

### GS.3.1 Creation and annihilation

For a representation W of Ĝ^I, a diagonal-Ĝ-invariant vector x and covector ξ give maps from the trivial representation to W^ζ and back, where ζ:I→{0}. Transport these coefficient maps by coalescence to create I legs from one trivial leg and annihilate them. These maps are defined on the HN cohomology systems before passage to Hecke-finite fibres. They commute with the integral Hecke action, preserve Hecke finiteness once it is defined, and satisfy the rigid tensor evaluation/coevaluation identities.

*Construction.* Apply coefficient functoriality to x:1→W^ζ and ξ:W^ζ→1. Use fusion comparisons to move to separate legs. Verify the two triangle identities using evaluation and coevaluation before specializing.

*Remark.* The invariant condition is for diagonal Ĝ, not each independent factor of Ĝ^I.

The API:

- `CreateLegs` (constructor): Creation from a specified invariant vector.
- `AnnihilateLegs` (constructor): Annihilation with a specified invariant covector.
- `CreateAnnihilate.triangle` (compatibility): Rigid tensor triangles survive coefficient functoriality and fusion.

**Checks.**

- For W=1 and x=ξ=1 creation followed by annihilation is the identity.
- For V⊠V∗ the canonical coevaluation and evaluation give the usual trace.
- Scaling x by a scales the composite by a; normalization must not discard the chosen invariant vector.

Define `HeckeFinite`. An element h in an E-valued shtuka-cohomology fibre is Hecke-finite if it belongs to a finitely generated O_E-submodule stable under every integral Hecke operator. The union of these lattices is an E-vector subspace H^Hf, stable under the Hecke algebra and the existing geometric actions. Finite-dimensional E-stability alone is a different condition.

*Construction.* Close the collection of stable finite O_E-modules under sums. Scale such modules by elements of E to prove the union is an E-subspace. Use commutation with integral Hecke operators to transport finite witnesses through coefficient and geometric maps.

*Remark.* The integral lattice is the witness; the entire E-space is not required to be finitely generated over O_E.

The API:

- `HeckeFinite` (data): Existence of a finite O_E-submodule containing h and stable under all integral operators.
- `HeckeFinite.part` (constructor): The E-subspace formed by the union of such modules.
- `HeckeFinite.map` (functoriality): A Hecke-equivariant linear map carries a finite witness to a finite witness.
- `HeckeFinite.finiteLattice` (characterisation): A finite family of Hecke-finite vectors lies in one finite stable O_E-module.

**Checks.**

- Zero lies in the zero stable submodule.
- On E=Q_ℓ, the operator multiplication by ℓ⁻¹ has finite E-dimensional orbit span of 1, but no finitely generated Z_ℓ-submodule containing 1 can be stable under it.
- If every operator is integral scalar multiplication, each O_E·h is a finite stable witness.

### GS.3.3 Horocycle compact direct images

For κ with every Ni>max(2g−2,0), the map qκ from the PGL₂ horocycle to the rank-one shtuka chain of degrees Ni is smooth of dimension d=r−#I(κ)/2, with geometric fibres [G_a^d/Z] for a finite étale translation group Z. Thus Rπκ!Q_ℓ=Rπ₁!Q_ℓ\[−2d\](−d), and Pκ=Rπκ!Q_ℓ\[2r\](r)=Rπ₁!Q_ℓ\[#I(κ)\](#I(κ)/2), pure perverse of weight zero on X(κ).

*Proof.* Map each maximal line/quotient ratio to Pic^{Ni}, yielding a rank-one shtuka chain. At high instability H¹ of the ratio line bundle vanishes; express each fibre as a quotient of vector groups and impose Frobenius at the endpoints. Compute the vector-group dimension using Riemann–Roch and the number of rising/falling steps. Compact support gives the shift and twist.

*Remark.* The high-instability inequality is needed for the vector-group presentation.

*Remark.* Use the positive shift \[#I(κ)\](#I(κ)/2) from YZ Corollary 3.29; the displayed recall at the start of YZ §3.5.4 has the opposite sign (Source corrections, E1).

### GS.3.4 PGL₂ ind-perverse cohomology

Define `PGL2Shtuka.indPerverse` and `PGL2Shtuka.middleCompact`. For K^{≤κ}=Rπ^{≤κ}_!Q_ℓ\[2r\](r), define pH^iK as colimκ pH^iK^{≤κ} in Ind(Perv); this notation does not postulate a constructible derived object K for the unbounded stack. Set V=colimκ H_c^{2r}(Sht^{≤κ},Q_ℓ)(r). Hecke correspondences act on the system and on V; Atkin–Lehner involutions commute with them. The cycle class map and the compact-support pairing are equivariant, with inverse correspondences giving adjoints.

The calculus modulo constructible objects is part of this target: form the Ind-category of perverse sheaves on the leg base (Mathlib `CategoryTheory.Ind`), take the Serre class of ind-objects whose perverse pieces are constructible, and work in the localization by morphisms that are isomorphisms modulo that class (Mathlib `ObjectProperty.IsSerreClass` and `isoModSerre`); an mc-isomorphism is a morphism inverted there.

*Construction.* Use extension by zero for increasing bounded opens, and form each perverse-degree colimit in the Ind-category. Construct Hecke pull–push maps with their proper support, and compare their compositions. Use proper and étale base change to prove the same statements after the ramified leg base change of YZ §3.2, and check that Atkin–Lehner involutions commute with the correspondences.

The API:

- `PGL2Shtuka.indPerverse` (data): The filtered perverse-cohomology objects, one object for each i.
- `PGL2Shtuka.middleCompact` (data): The direct limit V in degree 2r and twist r.
- `PGL2Shtuka.hecke` (functoriality): Correspondences act compatibly with bound transitions.
- `PGL2Shtuka.pairing` (compatibility): Cycle classes, duality adjoints and Atkin–Lehner symmetries.

**Checks.**

- At a fixed finite-type truncation, ordinary constructible compact cohomology is recovered.
- The symmetric PGL₂ spherical generator is self-adjoint, since its double coset equals its inverse.
- After a leg base change, pullback of every finite truncation system agrees with the system used for Sht′; do not replace it with an unrelated abstract Hecke module.

### GS.3.5 Cuspidal shtuka cohomology

Define `ShtukaCohom.cuspidal`. For split G and fixed j, I, W, at a geometric point whose coordinates are generic and satisfy no nonzero Frobenius-graph relation (Xue-I §2.3.8; this includes the generic point of the product and the generic point of the diagonal), define H^{j,cusp,O_E} as the intersection of the kernels of all proper-parabolic constant-term maps on the HN-colimit compactly supported cohomology H^{j,O_E}. The codomain of each constant-term map is the cohomology of the modified Levi stack, with its degree components and support conditions; it cannot be replaced by the cohomology of an unmodified Levi stack. Over E the analogous kernel is H^{j,cusp,E}.

The geometric inputs of the constant-term comparison — the contraction of deep horospherical strata onto Levi shtukas and the constant-term geometry of Xue's earlier work on cuspidal cohomology, cited in Xue-I §3.1 — are part of this target.

*Construction.* Use the correspondence through the parabolic, from G-shtukas to Levi shtukas, with the coefficient sheaf pulled back from Satake. Pass to the direct limit in the G-bound and in the modified Levi degree components. Intersect the proper-parabolic kernels and prove Hecke compatibility through the constant-term homomorphism of Hecke algebras.

*Remark.* All proper parabolics, or a source-proved detecting family of maximal ones, are required.

The API:

- `ShtukaCohom.constantTerm` (constructor): The componentwise map to the modified Levi cohomology.
- `ShtukaCohom.cuspidal` (data): The simultaneous kernel, with its inclusion into the full HN colimit.
- `ShtukaCohom.constantTerm_hecke` (compatibility): The map intertwines the unnormalized constant-term homomorphism of the Hecke algebras.
- `ShtukaCohom.cuspidal_baseChange` (compatibility): After tensoring with E, integral cuspidal cohomology gives the rational cuspidal subspace.

**Checks.**

- For a torus the intersection is over an empty family and is all cohomology.
- With no legs, trivial W and j = 0, one obtains the cuspidal functions of [§GS.0.14 *Cuspidal functions and bundle functions*](#gs-0-cuspidal-automorphic-forms), not all compactly supported functions.
- For GL₂ a compactly supported function with nonzero upper-triangular constant term is excluded, even though its support is finite.

### GS.3.6 Hecke operators from Frobenius

For a good place v∈U∖|N| and V∈Rep Ĝ define S_{V,v} by creating V⊠V∗, applying Frob_first^{deg v}, then annihilating, with the source’s descent from a geometric point over v. On the locus where existing legs avoid v, this equals T(h_{V,v}); hence it extends that spherical Hecke action across v. The dimension-parity sign in the normalized h_{V,v} is essential.

The full correspondence computation of VL §§6.2–6.5, including the identities of Lemmas 6.11–6.15 for intersection complexes and convolution, is part of this target; the minuscule case does not suffice.

*Proof.* Express creation and annihilation by cohomological correspondences supported on the relevant fusion diagonals. Compare the Frobenius-twisted correspondence with the bounded local Hecke correspondence; the general bound uses IC and convolution rather than a minuscule replacement. Apply the trace/correspondence identity and track the normalized sign; commute with total Frobenius to descend from the chosen geometric point.

The API `ShtukaHecke.frobeniusOperator`, `ShtukaHecke.choiceIndependent` and `ShtukaHecke.awayComparison` gives the operator, its independence of the chosen geometric point and its agreement with the spherical correspondence.

**Checks.**

- V=1 gives the identity spherical operator, since evaluation after coevaluation on the unit is 1.
- At a degree-two place the construction uses two partial Frobenius iterates and q_v=q²; a single iterate lies over the wrong point before descent.
- For GL₂ and the minuscule standard representation, the orbit has dimension one. On its open stratum the normalized perverse IC has trace −q_v^{−1/2}, while h_{V,v} has value +q_v^{−1/2}; omitting the parity correction changes the operator's sign.

### GS.3.7 The Eichler–Shimura relation

If dim V=d and F₀ is partial Frobenius on the extra V-leg, then Σ_{i=0}^d(−1)^i(F₀^{deg v})^i∘S_{Λ^{d−i}V,v}=0. Here S is the creation–Frobenius–annihilation operator; the relation is proved before identifying S with a Hecke operator. The latter identification gives the polynomial recurrence with integral spherical coefficients.

*Proof.* Form the alternating projector on V^{⊗(d+1)} and use Λ^{d+1}V=0. Contract all but one tensor factor against Frobenius, grouping permutations by the cycle through the distinguished factor. This gives the signed exterior-power polynomial; clear the characteristic-zero factorial denominators in the projector argument and track the source’s integral operators.

*Remark.* For d=1, S_{V,v}=F₀^{deg v}.

*Remark.* For d=2 the relation is F²−S_V F+S_det=0; reversing exterior indices fails.

`Suggested.lean` states the consequence used in [§GS.4.5 *Finite lisse envelopes*](#gs-3-hecke-finite-part-is-a-union-of-constructible-subsheaves): an operator killed by a monic integral polynomial has every vector in a finite stable O_E-lattice (`finiteLattice_of_monic_recurrence`).

### GS.3.8 The no-leg cusp identification

Under the no-leg/trivial-coefficient identification, H_{∅,1}^Hf=C_c^cusp((⊔αGα(F)\Gα(A)/Kα,N)/Ξ,E). In fact finite-dimensionality of the E-orbit under one spherical Hecke algebra at a split place already forces cuspidality. The integral cusp-function lattice is finite and Hecke-stable.

*Proof.* Cuspidal finite-dimensionality and the integral-function lattice give Hecke finiteness. For a nonzero constant term use a contracting central cocharacter in a proper Levi. Its translates shift an integer support coordinate. Compact support bounds that coordinate on one side, incompatible with a nonzero finite-dimensional shift-stable orbit. Thus every proper constant term vanishes.

*Remark.* For a torus the cusp condition is vacuous and the central quotient gives the finite function space.

*Remark.* Finite O_E-generation is asserted for the integral lattice, not for the nonzero E-vector space as an O_E-module.

### GS.3.9 PGL₂ boundary constant terms

On a cofinal set of truncations containing the low-instability core, the perverse transitions are injective in degree 0, surjective in degree 1 and isomorphisms otherwise; nonzero perverse degrees eventually stabilize. There is an mc-isomorphism γ:pH⁰K→⊕κ∈K♯r Pκ. It intertwines the Hecke action with the Satake–Picard action modulo constructible errors. Restricting translations to high indices gives an mc-action, not an honest group action on that restricted direct sum.

*Proof.* Use the localization triangles only after all added horocycles satisfy the high-instability hypothesis of YZ Lemma 3.28. Compare the finite-type core and its complement; the core contributes constructible kernel and cokernel. Split the high boundary according to distinct support classes X(κ), identify the top-dimensional generic fibres, and compare Hecke adjacency with Picard translation.

*Remark.* The cofinal high-bound condition prevents applying the pure-perverse calculation to low horocycles.

*Remark.* Do not assume every horocycle is closed over the generic point of its support; YZ Remark 3.35 explicitly avoids that claim.

### GS.3.10 Integral cusp finiteness

For split G and all cohomological degrees j, finite leg sets I and finite coefficient representations W in the setting of Xue-I, H^{j,cusp,O_E} is finitely generated over O_E, equals the integral Hecke-finite submodule, and extends to H^{j,cusp,E}=H^{j,Hf,E}. The cuspidal submodule lies in the image of the cohomology of one sufficiently large HN truncation, which is a finite O_E-module (Xue-I, Proposition 3.2.2); no injectivity of the truncation maps is asserted. This proves the Hecke-finite/cuspidal equality for arbitrary legs and degrees in the split case, strengthening the original empty-leg theorem.

The deep-horosphere contraction and constant-term geometry cited in Xue-I §3.1 are part of this target, as in [§GS.3.5 *Cuspidal shtuka cohomology*](#gs-3-cuspidal-shtuka-cohomology).

*Proof.* Use deep instability and constant-term comparison to show that the image of one sufficiently large truncation contains the entire cuspidal kernel. Its finite-type cohomology is a finite O_E-module. A nonzero proper-parabolic constant term admits central-Levi Hecke translates moving to unbounded degree components; they contradict a finite integral Hecke orbit. Conversely the finite cuspidal module is Hecke-stable. Prove constant-term kernels commute with extension to E using the uniform integral bounds, then use the cuspidal integral lattice to identify rational Hecke-finiteness.

*Remark.* This is not a finiteness assertion for the entire HN colimit.

*Remark.* The nonsplit rational descent theorem below does not by itself extend this integral cuspidal theorem.

### GS.3.11 The PGL₂ Eisenstein spectral decomposition

Let H̄ be the image of H_G^Σ⊗Q_ℓ in End(V)×Q_ℓ[Pic_X(F_q)]^ι. For f in the Eisenstein ideal, fV is finite-dimensional. For every spherical place y, V is finite over H_y⊗Q_ℓ; H̄ is a finite-type algebra of Krull dimension one and V is finite over it. Its reduced spectrum is the disjoint union of the Eisenstein curve Spec Q_ℓ[Pic_X(F_q)]^ι and finitely many isolated points; V=V_Eis⊕V₀ canonically, with V₀ finite-dimensional. The ramified base-changed stack has the analogous decomposition and equivariant pairing.

*Proof.* Compare middle compact cohomology with global sections of pH⁰K; stabilized nonzero perverse degrees give finite-dimensional errors. The mc-zero action of the Eisenstein ideal then has finite rank. Filter by growing instability in steps deg y. The associated graded spherical action is the Picard translation isomorphism in high degree. Use purity of boundary pieces and the stabilized weight≤0 part of H¹ to show a finite initial segment generates V over H_y. Noetherianity makes the Eisenstein ideal finitely generated, so its action has finite-dimensional support. Separate that support from the Eisenstein curve to obtain the canonical splitting.

*Remark.* The isolated non-Eisenstein sector is finite-dimensional; the whole V need not be.

*Remark.* The proof uses any spherical place, not only a specially chosen degree-one place.

### GS.3.12 Finiteness over one local Hecke algebra

For split G, all j,I,W and every good closed place u outside N, H^{j,O_E}_{N,I,W} at the geometric fibres specified in Xue-I §2.3.8 is a finite module over the single spherical Hecke algebra H^{O_E}_{G,u}. Its O_E-torsion has bounded exponent. It can be infinite over O_E: being finite over a finitely generated Hecke algebra is a different condition from the integral Hecke-finite condition used for the cuspidal subspace.

*Proof.* Filter the colimit by HN bounds. In a sufficiently unstable maximal-parabolic sector, constant terms identify adjacent associated-graded pieces with Levi pieces. A central-Levi cocharacter Hecke operator translates those graded pieces isomorphically toward a bounded region. Induction on the truncation filtration shows one bounded piece generates under H_{G,u}. The bounded piece is finite over O_E. The spherical Hecke algebra is Noetherian; the ascending chain of λ-power torsion submodules therefore stabilizes.

*Remark.* The choice of u is arbitrary among good places.

*Remark.* Do not conclude that every vector has a finite O_E Hecke orbit.

### GS.3.13 The PGL₂ finite-type core

For standard Iwahori PGL₂ shtukas of r modifications, the complement of horocycles with every Ni>max(2g−2,0) is of finite type. Subject to the standard parity r≡#Σ∞ mod 2, the entire stack is of finite type exactly when r<#Σ∞. The large-instability horocycles are nonempty and infinite in number in the opposite case.

*Proof.* If one intermediate bundle has bounded parabolic instability, at most r elementary modifications bound the starting ordinary instability by r+max(2g−2,0)+deg Σ. If r<#Σ∞ the divisor endpoint condition prevents any admissible purely unstable sequence. For r≥#Σ∞ construct infinitely many admissible indices with Ni arbitrarily large; use the rank-one quotient of each horocycle to prove nonemptiness.

*Remark.* For Σ∞=∅ and even r the unrestricted stack is not finite type.

*Remark.* With r=0 and #Σ∞>0 even, the finite-type conclusion applies; no universal non-finite-type slogan is used.

### Examples

- *Integral versus rational finiteness.* On E = Q_ℓ with the single operator ℓ⁻¹, the vector 1 spans a one-dimensional stable E-line, but no finitely generated Z_ℓ-submodule containing 1 is stable: ℓ⁻ⁿ is in it for every n. So 1 is not Hecke-finite ([§GS.3.2 *Integral Hecke finiteness*](#gs-3-hecke-finiteness)); `Suggested.lean` records this example.
- *Eichler–Shimura for d = 2.* For a two-dimensional V the relation is F² − S_V F + S_{Λ²V} = 0, with F the partial Frobenius at the extra leg raised to the power deg v ([§GS.3.7 *The Eichler–Shimura relation*](#gs-3-eichler-shimura-relation)); reversing the exterior indices gives a different, false relation. A monic relation of this kind is what bounds all Frobenius powers by a finite box in [§GS.4.5 *Finite lisse envelopes*](#gs-3-hecke-finite-part-is-a-union-of-constructible-subsheaves).
- *Tori.* For a torus every constant-term family is empty, so all cohomology is cuspidal, and the no-leg cusp space is the space of functions on the finite group of isomorphism classes of Bun_T(F_q)/Ξ.

## Layer GS.4: Drinfeld descent and product actions

Drinfeld's lemma, for finite étale covers and then for lisse sheaves with finite O_E-coefficients, comes before its use on cohomology. Hecke-finite vectors sit in finite lisse envelopes with partial Frobenius, which carry an action of the product Galois group; such an envelope embeds into one truncated cohomology sheaf only over a dense open where that sheaf is lisse. The functors H_{I,W} are assembled from these envelopes. The full-colimit route gives a Weil action of Weil(F)^I on the whole cohomology and its ind-smoothness, with separate hypotheses in the split integral case and the nonsplit rational case. Standing hypotheses are those of Layer GS.1.

### GS.4.1 Drinfeld’s lemma for finite étale covers

For U a smooth geometrically connected curve over F_q, finite étale covers of U^I equipped with commuting lifts of the partial Frobenius maps whose product is the canonical total Frobenius form a Galois category equivalent to finite sets with continuous π₁(U)^I-action. Basepoints are specified; equivalent formulations use the quotient by the partial Frobenius actions.

*Proof.* Use Lang’s finite-dimensional semilinear descent for finite étale data after extending constants. Descend finite étale algebras across partial Frobenius and recover the product of the finite-cover fibre functors. Verify fullness and essential surjectivity, including the product-of-lifts condition.

*Remark.* For I={1} recover the ordinary finite étale Galois category.

*Remark.* An arbitrary nonétale Frobenius-equivariant scheme need not descend: the twisted dual-number example of VL Remark 8.9 is excluded.

### GS.4.2 Drinfeld’s lemma for lisse coefficients

For a lisse sheaf of finitely generated O_E-modules on U^I with the compatible commuting partial Frobenius structure, the fibre carries a continuous π₁(U)^I-action, and the lisse-sheaf construction is inverse. The statement includes torsion modules; finite coefficient quotients and their inverse limits recover the general finitely generated case. For a sheaf initially lisse on a dense open, the extension lemma requires its partial-Frobenius compatibility and finiteness; it is not automatic for arbitrary generic representations.

*Proof.* Apply the finite-cover statement to finite coefficient quotients and use continuous inverse limits. For a dense lisse open, propagate using partial Frobenius and the source’s extension argument before applying the global U^I statement.

*Remark.* Rank one and I=1 agree with the usual lisse representation correspondence.

*Remark.* Without a finite module or locally finite semilinear descent hypothesis, the Laurent-polynomial example of VL Remark 8.6 prevents naïve descent.

### GS.4.3 The Frobenius–Weil group

Define `FrobeniusWeil`. Let F^I be the function field of X^I and fix an algebraic closure over the constant algebraic closure. FWeil consists of automorphisms whose restriction to the perfection of the constant-closed function field is a product of integer powers of the coordinate partial Frobenius maps. It fits into 1→π₁^geom(η^I)→FWeil→Z^I→0. A specialization to the diagonal supplies the map to Weil(F)^I; basepoint choices must be recorded.

*Construction.* Define the extension using the perfected geometric generic field and coordinate Frobenius. Extend an action of its geometric fundamental subgroup by the commuting partial Frobenius maps. Compare the diagonal specialization and its product Weil degrees; use the geometric constant-field kernel convention.

*Remark.* Feng §5.2.3 writes the wrong constant field in one subscript (Source corrections, E4); use the geometric kernel as in VL Remark 8.18, not the subgroup fixing the whole perfected function field.

The API:

- `FrobeniusWeil` (data): Automorphisms with a witnessed coordinate-Frobenius degree tuple.
- `FrobeniusWeil.degree` (projection): The homomorphism to Z^I with geometric kernel.
- `FrobeniusWeil.diagonal` (functoriality): The specialization-dependent map to Weil(F)^I.

**Checks.**

- For one leg the degree quotient is Z and the geometric kernel is the geometric absolute Galois group.
- For two legs the two coordinate degrees are independent; total Frobenius has degree (1,1).
- An element of the geometric kernel has degree zero in every coordinate; ordinary arithmetic Galois π₁ has a profinite degree quotient instead of Z^I.

### GS.4.4 Fusion and partial Frobenius

For ζ:I→J, partial Frobenius at a j-leg after coalescence corresponds to the product of the commuting partial Frobenius maps over ζ⁻¹(j), using the canonical coefficient comparison and compatible iterated presentations.

*Proof.* Refine the partitions so each relevant leg is separate. Check the cyclic rotations and the Satake fusion diagram before passing to the HN colimit.

*Remark.* For a bijection this is relabelling; for merging two legs it is a product of two commuting maps.

### GS.4.5 Finite lisse envelopes

Every finite O_E-submodule of the Hecke-finite generic fibre is contained in a finite O_E-module M̃ stable under the product Galois action, factoring through π₁(U′)^I for a dense open U′ depending on that piece. It is the generic fibre of a lisse O_E-sheaf on (U′)^I with compatible partial Frobenius. That sheaf embeds into one sufficiently large HN truncation only on a dense open Ω⊂(U′)^I where the truncation is lisse. No embedding on the whole product, no fixed U′ for every piece, and no single finite lattice for all cohomology are asserted.

*Proof.* Choose a finite integral Hecke-stable module inside one truncation and a product of closed points in its lisse open. At each coordinate use the Eichler–Shimura recurrence of degree deg(v_i)dim(W_i), with Hecke coefficients preserving the module. This bounds all Frobenius powers by a finite box. Take the finite partial-Frobenius-stable enlargement, extend its lisse locus using the source’s extension lemma, and apply Drinfeld’s lemma.

*Remark.* The finite Frobenius box is the missing bridge from Hecke finiteness to a product Galois action.

*Remark.* Retain the Ω restriction of VL Remark 8.28: its equality with the whole product is explicitly not needed or proved there.

<a id="gs-3-specialisation-is-an-isomorphism-on-hecke-finite-parts"></a>

### GS.4.6 Hecke-finite specialization

For a chosen specialization from the product generic point to the diagonal generic point, the induced map between the corresponding HN-colimit fibres is an isomorphism on Hecke-finite parts. Its inverse is used with the transported product Galois action; the eventual excursion endomorphism is independent of this choice.

*Proof.* For surjectivity, move a finite lisse envelope by partial Frobenius so a diagonal specialization meets its lisse open, then invert the finite Frobenius action. For injectivity, specialize a kernel vector to a closed diagonal point and form its multi-index partial-Frobenius iterates. Use the coordinate polynomial recurrences, density of the partial-Frobenius orbit and invertibility of total Frobenius to force the whole finite recurrence box to vanish.

*Remark.* The proof must establish injectivity as well as existence of a generic lift.

*Remark.* An arbitrary ind-constructible sheaf without the recurrences has no such specialization theorem.

### GS.4.7 The product Galois action

The FWeil action on H^Hf factors uniquely through Gal(F̄/F)^I on an E-representation which is a filtered union of finite-dimensional continuous subrepresentations. Each finite subset is contained in a finite O_E-module whose action factors through π₁(U′)^I for some smaller nonempty U′⊂U; the open may depend on that finite piece.

*Proof.* Place the finite subset in a partial-Frobenius-stable lisse envelope. Apply the lisse Drinfeld lemma and pass through the directed union. Check agreement on overlapping finite envelopes for uniqueness and continuity.

*Remark.* No claim is made that the entire ind-cohomology carries a product Galois action by this argument.

<a id="gs-3-the-functor-h-i-w"></a>

### GS.4.8 The cohomology functors H_{I,W}

Define `ShtukaH`. Define H_{I,W} as the Hecke-finite diagonal-generic fibre of the HN cohomology system, transported through the specialization isomorphism when a product-generic fibre is needed. It is an E-linear functor in Rep_E(Ĝ^I), a Gal(F̄/F)^I representation which is a filtered union of finite-dimensional continuous subrepresentations, and has the coalescence isomorphisms χζ and the commuting Hecke action. For I=∅, W=1 it is the cusp space.

*Construction.* Take the specified Hecke-finite subspace and use specialization to transport the product Galois action. Verify naturality and independence of the chosen specialization on common finite lisse envelopes. For split G record the finite-dimensionality improvement cited in Xue-I; the main construction uses only the ind-finite statement and does not assume the improvement for every nonsplit case.

*Remark.* Do not impose a tensor equivalence between all H spaces; the needed structure is the indexed functor with fusion.

The API:

- `ShtukaH` (data): The specified Hecke-finite fibre and its Hecke action.
- `ShtukaH.map` (functoriality): An E-linear coefficient functor in W.
- `ShtukaH.galois` (structure): A continuous action on each finite-dimensional stable piece.
- `ShtukaH.fusion` (compatibility): χζ natural in W and coherent in ζ, including the empty set.

**Checks.**

- H_{∅,1} is exactly the cusp space, including the Ξ quotient.
- Adding a trivial leg does not change the underlying Hecke module.
- For ζ merging two legs, coefficients restrict by g↦(g,g), so V⊠V∗ becomes V⊗V∗, rather than forgetting a factor.

### GS.4.9 Galois equivariance of coalescence

The map χζ:H_{I,W}≃H_{J,W^ζ} intertwines Gal(F̄/F)^J via the coordinate-diagonal map Gal^J→Gal^I. It is E-linear, Hecke-equivariant, natural in W and compatible with composition of maps of finite sets.

*Proof.* Restrict the comparison to common finite lisse envelopes. Compare partial Frobenius and specialization on each envelope, then apply the uniqueness part of Drinfeld descent.

*Remark.* Merging I={1,2} to one leg restricts γ↦(γ,γ), rather than multiplying two Galois elements.

### GS.4.10 Naturality of leg operations

Creation and annihilation commute with Hecke operators away from the added legs and with partial Frobenius on unaffected legs. After the extended spherical action is constructed, the resulting excursions are endomorphisms of the full Hecke module. On created legs the operations retain the ordered Galois/Frobenius insertion rather than commuting it away.

*Proof.* Compare the Cartesian correspondence diagrams on separate legs. Use coefficient naturality, fusion coherence and the extended Hecke identity to descend the commutation relation.

*Remark.* For W=1 this reduces to commutation of the identity with the Hecke action.

### GS.4.11 Independence of specialization choices

Changing the product-generic point, specialization arrow or finite lisse envelope changes the transported Galois/fusion data by the corresponding comparison isomorphism. In the creation–action–annihilation composite these comparisons cancel, giving a canonical no-leg endomorphism.

*Proof.* Place both sets of choices inside a common finite lisse envelope. Compare the two specialization maps and use naturality of the coefficient maps at both ends. Cancel the conjugating comparison in the complete excursion composite.

*Remark.* Canonicity is asserted for the endomorphism, not for a chosen basepoint identification of absolute Galois groups.

<a id="gs-4-full-cohomology-weil-descent"></a>

### GS.4.12 Weil descent on full cohomology

The Frobenius–Weil action on the full HN-colimit shtuka cohomology factors through Weil(F)^I: with O_E coefficients for split G as in Xue-I, and with E coefficients for the connected reductive nonsplit groups of the parahoric setting of Xue-S §6. This statement is about Weil groups and the full colimit; it does not assert an action of the full profinite Galois group on a finite-dimensional space.

*Proof.* For a finite module M over a finitely generated commutative O_E-algebra A, reduce modulo powers of every maximal ideal m. If λ ∈ m the quotients are finite torsion O_E-modules; otherwise λ is invertible on A/mⁿ and the quotients are finite-dimensional over E. Apply the finite-coefficient or the rational Drinfeld lemma accordingly (Source corrections, E6). Use the Krull intersection theorem and localization to kill the kernel of the Frobenius–Weil action on M; in the split integral case use finiteness over one local Hecke algebra. For nonsplit G with rational coefficients, use the finite Hecke envelopes given by the Eichler–Shimura recurrence and finite local Hecke tensor products, and take their directed union. This uses semisimplicity of rational representations, not an integral semisimplicity claim.

*Remark.* A finite A-module need not be finite over O_E.

*Remark.* Descent of the full profinite Galois group on the integral Hecke-finite part is [§GS.4.7 *The product Galois action*](#gs-4-galois-action-on-hecke-finite-cohomology), a different theorem.

<a id="gs-4-ind-smoothness-of-full-cohomology"></a>

### GS.4.13 Ind-smoothness of full cohomology

For E coefficients and G with the parahoric model and good open of Xue-S §6, the entire cohomology ind-sheaf H^j_{N,I,W} is ind-smooth over (U∖|N|)^I: every specialization to the geometric generic fibre induces an isomorphism. The product Weil action factors through Weil(U∖|N|)^I. For split G with O_E coefficients, specialization from the diagonal generic fibre to the generic product is an isomorphism by Xue-I, Proposition 8.1.2; the stronger nonsplit integral assertion is not inferred from the rational theorem.

The pseudo-product sheaves and the specialization theorem for products of strictly henselian traits of Xue-S §§2–3, used in the second step, are part of this target.

*Proof.* First prove invariance under specialization on the generic product, using finite Frobenius envelopes and the injectivity argument. Use the tensor evaluation/coevaluation identity, pseudo-product sheaves and the source’s specialization theorem on products of strictly henselian traits to prove the specialization maps at closed leg tuples are isomorphisms. Factor general specializations through a closed tuple to obtain ind-smoothness on the good product. Apply the same method to the parahoric/nonsplit geometry with its twisted Satake coefficients. Preserve the rational coefficient hypothesis; record the distinct split integral diagonal-specialization theorem.

*Remark.* The untruncated ind-sheaf need not be one finite-rank lisse sheaf.

*Remark.* The theorem includes collision diagonals inside the good product, not just distinct legs.

### Examples

- *One leg.* For I = {1} Drinfeld's lemma is the usual equivalence between finite étale covers of U and finite continuous π₁(U)-sets, and the Frobenius–Weil group is an extension of Z by the geometric Galois group.
- *Two legs.* For I = {1, 2} the degree map of the Frobenius–Weil group is onto Z², total Frobenius has degree (1, 1), and merging the two legs restricts a pair of Galois elements along γ ↦ (γ, γ); it does not multiply them ([§GS.4.9 *Galois equivariance of coalescence*](#gs-4-coalescence-is-galois-equivariant)).
- *A counterexample to naive descent.* A finite module over a finitely generated O_E-algebra need not be finite over O_E: O_E[t]/(λt − 1) is the field E. This is why the Weil descent of [§GS.4.12 *Weil descent on full cohomology*](#gs-4-full-cohomology-weil-descent) separates maximal ideals containing λ from the others (Source corrections, E6).

## Layer GS.5: global excursions and the parameterization

This layer realizes the abstract excursion data of LanglandsParameterStacks by creation, Galois action and annihilation of legs on the cohomology of shtukas, proves their relations, continuity and unramifiedness, and applies the reconstruction of parameters from their characters. The result is V. Lafforgue's decomposition of the cusp space into generalized excursion eigenspaces indexed by semisimple global parameters, with scalar spherical Hecke action at good places in characteristic zero. The integral and modular blocks, the action on the full compactly supported cohomology, the conditional comparison with eigensheaves and the conjectural multiplicity description are separate targets, each with its own hypotheses. Standing hypotheses are those of Layer GS.1.

<a id="gs-5-excursion-operator"></a>

### GS.5.1 Global excursion operators

For finite I, W∈Rep_E(Ĝ^I), diagonal-Ĝ-invariant x∈W and ξ∈W∗, and (γi)∈Gal(F̄/F)^I, define S_{I,W,x,ξ,γ} on C_c^cusp(Bun_{𝒢,N}(F_q)/Ξ,E) by creation at the generic diagonal, inverse coalescence to H_{I,W}, action of (γi), coalescence back and annihilation. It is independent of the specialization choices and commutes with the full level-N Hecke algebra.

*Construction.* Identify the trivial-coefficient no-leg space with cusp forms by VL Proposition 8.23. Compose the coefficient maps and the product Galois action on the Hecke-finite space; compare specialization choices using VL Remark 9.4. Use the correspondence naturality on each finite envelope and pass to the union.

*Remark.* The definition is an actual action on the cusp space, not a new abstract generator with assumed relations.

The API:

- `GlobalExcursion.operator` (constructor): The endomorphism from (I,W,x,ξ,γ).
- `GlobalExcursion.choiceIndependent` (characterisation): Any common refinement of the specialization choices gives the same endomorphism.
- `GlobalExcursion.heckeLinear` (compatibility): It belongs to the commutant of the full level-N Hecke action.

**Checks.**

- For W=1 and ξ(x)=a the operator is a·Id, including a=0.
- With all γi=1 the operator is ξ(x)·Id.
- For I={1,2}, W=V⊠V∗, x=coevaluation and ξ=evaluation, (Frob_v,1) gives the normalized spherical Hecke operator; no ordinary trace at one leg replaces this two-leg construction.

<a id="gs-5-invariant-functions-and-the-index-f"></a>

### GS.5.2 Invariant-function indexing

The shtuka operator depends on (W, x, ξ) only through the function f((g_i)) = ξ((g_i)x) in O(Ĝ\Ĝ^I/Ĝ), and every such invariant function is a matrix coefficient of this form. So the geometric construction gives an operator S_{I,f,γ}. This realizes the abstract excursion data of LanglandsParameterStacks §§LP2e.13–LP2e.14; it does not redefine them.

*Proof.* For a matrix coefficient take the cyclic subrepresentation generated by x and quotient by the largest subrepresentation annihilated by ξ. Identify the quotient with the finite-dimensional translation span of f in O(Ĝ^I/Ĝ). Apply naturality of H to the injection and quotient, so the composite depends only on this canonical cyclic coefficient.

*Remark.* No freeness or preferred decomposition of W is used.

*Remark.* For I=1 the double quotient has only constants; conjugation-invariant functions of one group variable correspond to two legs.

Source: [VL](#ref-vl), §10, Notation 10.5, Lemma 10.6 and Notation 10.7, pp. 137–138.

*Needs:* [§GS.5.1 *Global excursion operators*](#gs-5-excursion-operator); LanglandsParameterStacks §LP2e.13 (excursion data); LanglandsParameterStacks §LP2e.14 (excursion matrix coefficients).

The light matrix-coefficient function `excursionFunction` evaluates ξ on the tuple action on x. Its API consists of its value at the identity and `excursionFunction_diagonal_invariant` (invariance under the diagonal on both sides); the abstract excursion datum remains in LanglandsParameterStacks.

**Checks.**

- ξ=0 gives the identically zero function, and the identity tuple gives ξ(x).
- With one leg and invariant x the function is the constant ξ(x), even for a nontrivial ambient representation; it is not an arbitrary class function of one group element.
- For Ĝ=SL₂, W=V⊠V∨, and coevaluation/evaluation as x,ξ, the function is tr(g₁g₂⁻¹). At (diag(2,1/2),1) over Q it is 5/2, whereas at (1,1) it is 2. This pins both the relative inverse and the nonconstant two-leg case.

### GS.5.3 Satake scalars and parameter separation

For a good place v∈U∖|N|, f(g1,g2)=χV(g1g2⁻¹) and γ∈Gal(F̄_v/Fv) of Weil degree d≥0, S_{{1,2},f,(γ,1)} depends only on d, and for d=1 equals T(h_{V,v}). Chebotarev and continuity determine all single-element semisimple classes from good-place Satake data. This determines a semisimple GL_r representation by its trace, but does not imply simultaneous conjugacy of general reductive-group parameters; all-tuples excursions supply that stronger separation.

*Proof.* Transport partial Frobenius through the specialization comparison to obtain the dependence on d only, and use VL Proposition 6.2 when d = 1. Use Chebotarev density only for continuous class functions, which gives information on individual conjugacy classes. For GL_r, use the semisimple reconstruction of determinants over an algebraically closed field and, in characteristic zero, the injectivity of the trace on determinants (IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants IHG.0–IHG.1; this is Taylor's pseudocharacter theorem, recalled in VL Remark 11.8). For general Ĝ keep the invariants of all tuples.

*Remark.* For general Ĝ, homomorphisms that are conjugate element by element need not be conjugate; only the invariants of all tuples separate parameters, and this theorem uses no more than that distinction.

### GS.5.4 Excursions on full compact cohomology

Define `CompactShtukaCohom.excursion`. For split G, finite retained legs J, a coefficient representation V ∈ Rep_{O_E}(Ĝ^J) on a finitely generated module, finite auxiliary legs I disjoint from J, W ∈ Rep_{O_E}(Ĝ^I) on a finitely generated module, diagonal-Ĝ-invariant x ∈ W and ξ ∈ W∗, a tuple γ ∈ Weil(F̄/F)^I and any j∈Z, define S^{O_E}_{I,W,x,ξ,γ} on H^{j,O_E}_{N,J,V} restricted to the generic point of the diagonal of X^J by creating the legs I, applying the product Weil action (trivially on the J coordinates) and annihilating I. The operators commute with proper-parabolic constant terms and with extension of scalars to E. At J = ∅, V = 1, j = 0 they act on the whole space of compactly supported automorphic functions, including its noncuspidal part. The nonsplit version with E coefficients uses ind-smoothness.

For nonsplit G with torsion coefficients the construction is part of this target: Xue-I §8 treats split G and Xue-S §6 the nonsplit case with E coefficients, while GeL §9 uses the torsion version. The coefficient-natural specialization and constant-term arguments must be checked under the parahoric hypotheses of Xue-S §6.

*Construction.* Use the integral isomorphism of specialization to the diagonal to transport the full product Weil action; this avoids the restriction to Hecke-finite vectors. Create the auxiliary legs with x, insert identities on the retained legs, and annihilate with ξ. Use compatibility of the constant-term correspondences and the coefficient-natural Satake and cohomology maps to obtain the commuting diagrams.

*Remark.* The construction does not extend a finite-dimensional cusp operator to all functions by linear algebra alone.

The API:

- `CompactShtukaCohom.excursion` (constructor): Creation–Weil–annihilation on all cohomological degrees with the retained J legs.
- `CompactShtukaCohom.excursion_constantTerm` (compatibility): The proper-parabolic constant term intertwines the G and Levi operators.
- `CompactShtukaCohom.excursion_extendCoefficients` (functoriality): Extension O_E→E intertwines the integral and rational actions.
- `CompactShtukaCohom.excursion_cusp` (compatibility): Restriction to the cuspidal subspace agrees with the original global excursion.

- With I empty the operator is the scalar pairing ξ(x) on the unchanged J-cohomology.
- With J empty and V trivial, noncuspidal compactly supported functions remain in the domain.
- The action of an auxiliary tuple inserts identity in each J coordinate; letting it act on a retained leg would fail this test.

### GS.5.5 The global excursion identities

The shtuka realization satisfies the excursion relations of LanglandsParameterStacks §LP2e.10: f ↦ S_{I,f,γ} is a unital E-algebra map for each tuple γ; reindexing along ζ : I → J pulls back f and γ compatibly; disjoint unions multiply operators; and the three-copy identity inserts γ_i(γ′_i)⁻¹γ″_i into f. For each fixed f the map on tuples is continuous for the E-adic topology and factors through π₁(U)^I for some U. These relations are proved for the geometric operators, not imposed as axioms on the cusp space.

*Proof.* Tensor products and disjoint legs give multiplication; coefficient naturality gives linearity. Use fusion functoriality for reindexing. Insert coevaluation and evaluation in W⊗W∗⊗W and apply the two zigzag identities for the three-copy relation. Put each finite set of coefficient maps in a finite lisse envelope; this proves continuity without finite-dimensionality of all H_{I,W}.

*Remark.* The ordered expression is γ(γ′)⁻¹γ″; this order is what the reconstruction uses.

*Remark.* The universal presentation is LanglandsParameterStacks §LP2e.10's; this target verifies its hypotheses for global cohomology.

### GS.5.6 Unramifiedness of excursions

Every S_{I,f,γ} depends only on the image of γ in π₁(X∖|N|)^I, and the resulting map to the finite-dimensional excursion algebra is E-adically continuous. In the nonsplit case replace |N| by |N|∪(X∖U_𝒢), where 𝒢 is reductive on U_𝒢.

*Proof.* At v outside the bad set, creation is defined over the whole diagonal through v. VL Lemma 10.4 compares local Galois degree d with the d·deg(v) partial Frobenius iterate. For d=0 the created vectors are fixed by inertia in every coordinate, so inserting inertia changes no excursion. Pass from the individual inertia groups to the closed normal subgroup they generate in π₁(U), retaining continuity.

*Remark.* This proves factorization through the entire specified good open, not only an unspecified smaller open.

### GS.5.7 The global excursion algebra

Define `GlobalExcursion.algebra`. B_{N,Ξ,E} is the E-subalgebra of End_Hecke(C_c^cusp(Bun_{𝒢,N}(F_q)/Ξ,E)) generated by all S_{I,f,γ}. It is finite-dimensional and commutative, and contains the spherical Hecke operators at good places. After a finite coefficient extension splitting B, the cusp space decomposes into its generalized B-character spaces. Reducedness of B and diagonalizability of every excursion are not asserted.

*Construction.* The disjoint-union formula gives commutativity; finite-dimensionality of the cusp space makes B finite-dimensional. Use VL Lemma 10.2 to embed the spherical operators into B. Apply the primary decomposition for a finite-dimensional commutative algebra acting on a finite-dimensional vector space.

*Remark.* Use generalized eigenspaces even in characteristic zero; a finite-dimensional commutative algebra can have nilpotents.

The API:

- `GlobalExcursion.algebra` (data): The image algebra inside the Hecke commutant.
- `GlobalExcursion.generator` (constructor): Every geometric excursion has its canonical element of B.
- `GlobalExcursion.generalizedBlock` (data): The simultaneous generalized character subspace.
- `GlobalExcursion.primaryDecomposition` (structure): After a finite splitting extension the finite direct sum of blocks is the cusp space.

**Checks.**

- When the cusp space is zero the image algebra acts on the zero space and there are no nonzero blocks.
- For G_m, ordinary reciprocity characters give the usual rank-one Hecke decomposition.
- On E² a Jordan operator with a nonzero upper entry has one two-dimensional generalized block and a one-dimensional eigenspace; the block API must distinguish them.

### GS.5.8 Global reconstruction of parameters

For a character ν : B → Q̄_ℓ, the maps Θ_n^ν obtained by adding a base leg with γ₀ = 1 form a pseudocharacter of Γ = π₁(X ∖ |N|) with values in Ĝ. The reconstruction theorem for an arbitrary group (LanglandsParameterStacks §LP2c.2) gives a Ĝ-completely reducible σ_ν : Γ → Ĝ(Q̄_ℓ), unique up to Ĝ(Q̄_ℓ)-conjugacy, with ν(S_{I,f,γ}) = f((σ_ν(γ_i))). The continuity of σ_ν for the profinite topology of Γ and the E-adic topology, its definition over one finite extension E′/Q_ℓ, and the reductivity of its Zariski closure are part of this target (VL Proposition 11.7 and Lemmas 11.9–11.10); LP2c.3–LP2c.4 treat continuity for local Weil groups only. Distinct characters of B give distinct parameter classes.

*Proof.* Use Ĝⁿ//Ĝ ≅ Ĝ\Ĝ^{n+1}/Ĝ, (g₁, …, g_n) ↦ (1, g₁, …, g_n), to turn the geometric relations into compatible maps Θ_n. Apply the reconstruction of LP2c.2 to obtain σ_ν up to conjugacy. For continuity, fix a finite tuple whose closure is maximal reductive with minimal centralizer; it lies in one finite extension E′, uniqueness descends every further tuple entry to E′, and surjectivity of restriction to the coordinate ring of the double centralizer gives continuity. The invariant evaluations recover ν on all generators, which proves injectivity of ν ↦ [σ_ν].

*Remark.* The local-Weil continuity statements of LanglandsParameterStacks do not give continuity for the global profinite group; that step is part of this target.

*Remark.* Chebotarev equality of individual semisimple classes does not replace the theorem for all tuples.

### GS.5.9 The global cuspidal decomposition

For split G, fixed N and central lattice Ξ, there is a canonical finite direct-sum decomposition C_c^cusp(Bun_{G,N}(F_q)/Ξ,Q̄_ℓ)=⊕σ Hσ into full level-N Hecke submodules indexed by continuous semisimple global parameters unramified outside N, each defined over a finite Q_ℓ-extension. Hσ is the simultaneous generalized excursion eigenspace with evaluation f((σ(γi))). For every good v and irreducible V, T(h_{V,v}) acts on Hσ by the scalar χV(σ(Frob_v)). Zero summands may be omitted. No converse existence or general multiplicity formula is claimed.

*Proof.* Decompose the cusp space into primary B-character blocks and label each with its unique reconstructed parameter. Spherical Hecke operators have the required generalized eigenvalue by the excursion identity. Their adjoints are again spherical Hecke operators under the standard positive Hermitian pairing after scalar transport to C; commutativity makes them normal and diagonalizable. Their restriction to one generalized block therefore has the indicated scalar action.

*Remark.* The last step gives actual spherical Hecke scalars; it does not prove that every excursion is diagonalizable.

### GS.5.10 The nonsplit global decomposition

Let G/F be connected reductive with connected parahoric model 𝒢/X, reductive on U, and choose a finite splitting-of-pinning extension F̃/F. Put ᴸG = Ĝ ⋊ Gal(F̃/F). The full cusp space on Bun_{𝒢,N}(F_q)/Ξ, including ker¹ pure-inner-form components, has the canonical generalized excursion decomposition indexed by continuous semisimple σ : Gal(F̄/F) → ᴸG(E′), unramified outside |N|∪(X∖U), whose projection is the prescribed quotient to Gal(F̃/F). Good-place Satake operators act by χV(σ(Frob_v)), and the decomposition respects changes of N.

*Proof.* Use twisted Satake coefficients, and keep the nonconstant local system of diagonal-Ĝ invariants when defining creation and annihilation before passing to generic fibres. Verify the same identities with O(Ĝ\(ᴸG)^I/Ĝ); functions pulled back from the finite component quotient act by their prescribed scalar values. Apply the reconstruction of LanglandsParameterStacks §§LP2c.1–LP2c.2 for groups with reductive identity component and prescribed finite projection. The scalar values force the required projection, and the unramifiedness argument gives the stated good open. Compare restriction of level and all inner-form components through the common Hecke action.

*Remark.* The finite quotient and its projection are part of the parameter; replacing ᴸG by Ĝ loses the nonsplit arithmetic.

### GS.5.11 Integral and modular excursion blocks

Integral Satake coefficients make the excursion operators preserve the cusp O_E-lattice. Their reductions give, over F̄_ℓ, canonical generalized blocks indexed by continuous completely reducible parameters into the dual group over F̄_ℓ, with the prescribed L-group projection in the nonsplit case. The good-place Hecke action has the corresponding generalized eigenvalues; scalar action is not asserted in this coefficient branch.

*Proof.* Use the integral Satake coefficients of [§GS.1.14 *Integral geometric Satake*](#gs-1-integral-geometric-satake), with the integral perverse convention, and run the geometric correspondences on the O_E-lattice. Reduce the finite excursion algebra and apply the positive-characteristic reconstruction of LanglandsParameterStacks §LP2c.2, which uses Ĝ-complete reducibility, not the characteristic-zero criterion through reductive closures. Apply primary decomposition, without the Hermitian normality argument, which is unavailable in characteristic ℓ.

*Remark.* The integral Satake equivalence and the positive-characteristic reconstruction are separate inputs; neither follows from the rational Satake theorem.

### GS.5.12 The conditional eigensheaf comparison

For split G at empty level, suppose a Ξ-equivariant ℓ-adic Hecke eigensheaf F on Bun_G has eigen-local-system E and has cuspidal trace function f. Assume the additional trace-comparison maps in VL Proposition 15.1 are compatible with partial Frobenius. Then f lies in the global block H_σ for the Galois parameter of E. The required maps are coefficient-natural and fusion-compatible; partial-Frobenius compatibility is the explicitly unwritten input. This conditional application is not a prerequisite of the proven decomposition.

*Proof.* Use the Frobenius-graph trace construction to obtain π_{F,E,I,W}:colim_μ H^{0,≤μ}_{N,I,W}→W_E, natural in W and compatible with fusion. Assume its partial-Frobenius compatibility, which the source explicitly has not established in writing. Then creation–Galois–annihilation evaluates on f by f_I(σ(γ_i)). The empty-leg trace pairing identifies the resulting vector with the cusp trace function, so primary decomposition places it in H_σ.

*Remark.* This is a conditional statement: its extra hypothesis, compatibility of the trace maps with partial Frobenius, is assumed in VL Proposition 15.1 and is not proved there. It is not used by any other target.

Lafforgue's expected description H_{I,W} ≅ ⊕_σ (A_σ ⊗ W_{σ^I})^{S_σ} of the cohomology functors through multiplicity spaces A_σ and centralizer groups S_σ, and prove that its case I = ∅, W = 1 is consistent with the proved decomposition [§GS.5.9 *The global cuspidal decomposition*](#gs-5-the-main-decomposition). The Arthur-parameter and motivic-independence statements of VL Conjectures 12.7 and 12.12 are likewise only formulated.

- *Hecke operators are excursions.* For I = {1, 2}, W = V ⊠ V∗, x the coevaluation and ξ the evaluation, the operator attached to (Frob_v, 1) is the normalized spherical Hecke operator T(h_{V,v}) ([§GS.5.3 *Satake scalars and parameter separation*](#gs-5-satake-compatibility-and-chebotarev)).
- *Generalized eigenspaces.* On E² the operator with matrix rows (1, 1) and (0, 1) has a two-dimensional generalized eigenspace for the eigenvalue 1 but a one-dimensional eigenspace; the excursion decomposition of [§GS.5.7 *The global excursion algebra*](#gs-5-the-excursion-algebra) is by generalized eigenspaces, and `Suggested.lean` records this example.
- *Rank one.* For G = G_m the excursion decomposition is the decomposition of the cusp space (all functions on the finite group Pic(X)/Ξ) into characters, and the parameters are the rank-one Galois characters of class field theory.

## Layer GS.6: coefficient fields, companions and the GL_r excursion comparison

L. Lafforgue's global Langlands correspondence for GL_r over F belongs to AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3 (see Scope and ownership); this layer builds on it. It removes the finite-determinant hypothesis by constant twists, under the exact algebraicity and plainness conditions that this requires, proves the existence of ℓ-adic companions on curves, and compares the parameters of V. Lafforgue's excursion decomposition for GL_r with those of the correspondence. The comparison is a second route to the rank-r existence statement; the proof in AL.3 does not depend on Layer GS.5.

Standing hypotheses for this layer: G = GL_r with r ≥ 1; ℓ ≠ p; a fixed isomorphism Q̄_ℓ ≅ C where analytic statements are compared; local factors use one additive character and its self-dual measures.

<a id="gs-6-constant-twists-and-coefficient-fields"></a>

### GS.6.1 Constant twists and coefficient fields

For an irreducible lisse Q̄_ℓ-sheaf L on a smooth curve over F_q, a constant rank-one twist makes det L finite order. The stronger conclusion that this twist is algebraic and plain of characteristic p requires that the Frobenius eigenvalues of L be algebraic and units at every non-p place; being units only at the chosen ℓ-adic place is insufficient. Under Chin Proposition 4.3’s equivalent algebraicity/plainness hypotheses one may choose the constant scalar algebraic and plain of characteristic p, and apply the finite-determinant correspondence to the twisted sheaf. If L is additionally pure of a specified weight w, the normalizing twist can be chosen pure of weight −w; algebraicity and plainness alone do not impose a weight.

*Proof.* Use finiteness of the geometric determinant to find a constant β whose twist has finite determinant. Apply the finite-determinant theorem to the twist. Under the algebraic/plain hypotheses compare one Frobenius eigenvalue before and after twisting to prove β has the required number-theoretic properties. Undo the twist only in a coefficient category where the selected scalar is defined; its field need not be Q.

*Remark.* p-plainness is not inferred from continuity at a single ℓ-adic completion.

<a id="gs-6-companions-on-curves"></a>

### GS.6.2 Compatible systems on curves

For an irreducible finite-determinant lisse Q̄_ℓ-sheaf of rank r≥1 on a smooth curve, the good-place Frobenius polynomials lie in a number field; its eigenvalues are pure of weight zero and units at every place away from p. For each λ∤p there is an irreducible λ-adic companion with the same polynomials, after a finite local coefficient extension. More generally an algebraic p-plain irreducible sheaf belongs, after extending its number field, to a compatible system by the constant-twist reduction. For a reciprocal Frobenius root α at x and an additive valuation v_λ above p, the normalized slope bound is |v_λ(α)/v_λ(q^{deg x})|≤(r−1)²/r, as in LL VII.6(iv). Here deg x>0 and v_λ(q)>0, so the denominator is nonzero; for r=1 the bound is zero.

*Proof.* Use automorphic multiplicity one and the rationality field of π to get one number field for all Frobenius polynomials. Transport the automorphic representation to each λ-adic coefficient field and apply the GL_r theorem again. Use the essential-cohomology realization to descend a finite multiple of each companion and split the resulting central simple algebra over a finite extension. Apply the constant twist criterion for the p-plain extension. Do not assert crystalline companions from this argument.

*Remark.* Companions match the full characteristic polynomials at all good closed points, not only traces at one point.

*Remark.* Drinfeld's companions on smooth varieties of higher dimension are not part of this roadmap.

### GS.6.3 The GL_r excursion comparison

Assume the GL_s correspondence for all s < r. A GL_r parameter occurring in the excursion decomposition [§GS.5.9 *The global cuspidal decomposition*](#gs-5-the-main-decomposition) is irreducible and pure of weight zero. It therefore supplies the rank-r existence input of Deligne's induction, and it equals the parameter given by the GL_r correspondence of AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3. This is a second route; the proof in AL.3 does not use Layer GS.5.

*Proof.* If an occurring σ were reducible, attach lower-rank cusp representations to its irreducible factors after the required determinant twists. Good-place Satake matching would express L(π∨×π) as a product of unequal-rank Rankin–Selberg functions without its required pole. This is a contradiction. The geometric weight comparison of VL Lemma 16.2 and the finite-order determinant give weight zero; uniqueness identifies the parameter with LL’s σπ.

*Remark.* Layer GS.5 alone gives no converse theorem or multiplicity statement for general groups; this comparison uses the GL_r rank induction.

- *Why one ℓ is not enough.* A Frobenius eigenvalue can be an ℓ-adic unit and fail to be a unit at another place away from p; the constant-twist criterion of [§GS.6.1 *Constant twists and coefficient fields*](#gs-6-constant-twists-and-coefficient-fields) needs units at every place away from p.

## Layer GS.7: local excursions and comparison at every place

Genestier and V. Lafforgue restrict global shtukas to finite restricted shtukas near a place and use nearby cycles over the leg base to construct local excursion elements in the completed Bernstein centre. The finite jet budgets, the torsion exponent and the congruence level are kept visible in the finite construction; general-base nearby cycles are transported through the local correspondence before convolution and before passing to completed-centre limits. The endpoint is semisimple local–global compatibility for every connected reductive group, a separate GL_r comparison that keeps the monodromy operator, the action with additional global legs, and local gamma factors.

Standing hypotheses for this layer, in addition to those of Layer GS.1: K is a local field of characteristic p with finite residue field, and ℓ ≠ p; the restricted-shtuka construction first uses a split group over K with a chosen integral model, and the nonsplit extension uses parahoric models and the finite L-group; the congruence level m, torsion exponent s, jet bounds and Frobenius iteration budget are fixed in each finite construction and every comparison map respects them.

### GS.7.1 The unramified local comparison

At a good hyperspecial place v, the restriction of an occurring global parameter has trivial inertia, and χV(σ(Frob_v)) is the normalized Satake eigenvalue of πv for every dual-group representation V. For split G the spherical local excursion indexed by f(g1,g2)=χV(g1g2⁻¹) and (Frob_v,1) equals h_{V,v}. This is the first comparison case, proved before constructing the ramified local elements.

*Proof.* Use global unramifiedness and the good-place Satake scalar theorem. Identify the two-leg local convolution element using the same creation/Frobenius/annihilation calculation at hyperspecial level.

*Remark.* Normalize geometric Frobenius, the half Tate twist and volume one consistently with [§GS.1.11 *Normalized spherical Satake*](#gs-1-unramified-hecke-algebra-and-satake-isomorphism).

### GS.7.2 Finite restricted shtukas

Define `RestrictedShtuka`. Let K be a local field of characteristic p with finite residue field k, choose a smooth k-curve Y with rational point v and completed local field K, and a split reductive G. For fixed ordered legs I,W, large jet multiplicities ni, level nv and integer r≥0, a restricted shtuka is (yi,𝒢,z,θ): a G-torsor on D_r=nv+Σni yi+Σni σ⁻¹yi+⋯+Σni σ⁻r yi, a bounded modification z at Σni yi, and θ:σ(a_z𝒢)|D_{r−1}≃𝒢|D_{r−1}. The scheme-theoretic inverse Frobenius divisors retain their thickening. For r=0 read the source convention D_{−1}=nv. Restriction from a global shtuka is defined over U_{I,r}, with the disjointness condition GeL (2.10), and is smooth; decreasing jet data gives smooth restriction morphisms.

For nonsplit G at bad places the construction uses parahoric global and restricted shtukas and ind-proper affine flag varieties; GeL §9 cites Arasteh Rad–Hartl and Richarz (Theorem A) for these. Their connected-fibre and parahoric hypotheses, and the comparison with the finite-jet diagrams above, are part of this target.

*Construction.* Use finite-jet torsors and the contracted-product modification a_z from the bounded Hecke correspondence. Restrict the Frobenius identification only to the divisor on which both sides are defined; its inverse-image multiplicities are essential. Express a fibre of global restriction as an equalizer: one map is smooth forgetting level and the other has zero relative differential because it factors through Frobenius. This proves smoothness. Use the kernels of the jet-group restriction maps to describe the smooth transition fibres.

*Remark.* The integer r counts Frobenius iterations; it is not a rank.

*Remark.* These restricted shtukas are algebraic stacks of finite type, not the perfectoid local shtuka spaces of HeckeStacksAndLocalShtukas.

The API:

- `RestrictedShtuka` (data): Finite-jet torsor, bounded modification and restricted Frobenius isomorphism.
- `RestrictedShtuka.restrictGlobal` (functoriality): Restriction over the specified U_{I,r}, with its smoothness theorem.
- `RestrictedShtuka.restrictJets` (functoriality): Decrease (n,ni,r), preserving the coefficient comparison.
- `RestrictedShtuka.noLegs` (equivalence): For I=∅ identify the stack with B G(O_nv).

**Checks.**

- With I=∅ obtain B G(O_nv), rather than a discrete set with the automorphisms removed.
- For n=0,r=0 obtain the bounded Grassmannian modulo G_{Σni yi}.
- One partial Frobenius reduces the available iteration budget r by one; it is not an endomorphism of every fixed finite-jet stack.

### GS.7.3 Nearby cycles over higher-dimensional bases

Apply nearby cycles over the higher-dimensional leg base to the Satake sheaf tensored with the regular finite-level local system on the restricted-shtuka stack. With torsion coefficients Λ = O_E/λ^s, after a modification of the leg base depending on the chosen complex, the nearby cycles are bounded constructible and compatible with every further base change (Orgogozo's theorem). Proper forgetting of partitions and smooth restriction compare the nearby-cycle complexes. Orgogozo's theorem — nearby cycles on the oriented product over a coherent base of higher dimension, their constructibility and base change after a modification — is part of this target; EtaleDualityAndPerverseSheavesPartII EQ.3 supplies the oriented products and oriented cohomological descent, and LefschetzPencilsAndVanishingCycles Layer LPV.0 nearby cycles over a trait.

*Proof.* Construct the nearby-cycle functor on the oriented product over the leg base and prove Orgogozo's modification theorem (Org, Théorème 1.1 and Théorème 6.1) under its finite-presentation and invertible-torsion hypotheses. Descend the Satake coefficients along the finite-jet quotient and tensor with the regular G(O_{mv})-local system. Choose the modification of Y^I adapted to the complex, then use proper base change and smooth descent to transport the complexes across the restricted-shtuka diagrams.

*Remark.* Nearby cycles over a trait do not suffice.

*Remark.* The modification depends on the chosen coefficient complex; no single modification for all W and all s is asserted.

### GS.7.4 Transport on local nearby cycles

For δ in the local higher-variable Frobenius–Weil group with degree tuple (di), and a sufficiently increasing tuple (mi) with mi+di≥0, there is a local morphism Tδ:RΨ_{(mi)}SL→RΨ_{(mi+di)}SL on the same finite restricted-shtuka special fibre. It intertwines the specialization and FWeil action on every global truncation. The local FWeil group surjects onto Weil(K)^I. The theorem uses the general-base modification theorem and the Gabber ULA specialization comparison recalled in GeL (proof of Proposition 3.2); a direct trait specialization argument does not supply it.

*Proof.* Use Orgogozo’s modification so the nearby complex has arbitrary base-change compatibility. Choose the unique point on that modification approached by sufficiently separated Frobenius powers; the valuation comparison of GeL Lemmas 3.5–3.9 proves this independence. Combine the δ-map at the generic product with Gabber’s ULA comparison between the generic product and Frobenius diagonal, producing Tδ and the global square. Prove the local Drinfeld equivalence for finite étale algebras over iterated Laurent fields; it yields the required surjection to Weil(K)^I.

*Remark.* The stronger identification with iterated nearby cycles over traits in GeL Remark 3.12 is not used; the proof avoids it.

*Remark.* Gabber's comparison for universally locally acyclic complexes between the generic product and the Frobenius diagonal, recalled in GeL §3 (proof of Proposition 3.2), is part of this target; it is not an assumed base-change isomorphism.

### GS.7.5 Local excursion convolution elements

Define `LocalExcursion.convolution`. For split G/K, pro-p congruence U_m, whose finite quotients have order prime to ℓ, Λ=O_E/λ^s, f∈O(Ĝ\Ĝ^I/Ĝ)_Λ and (γi)∈Weil(K)^I, the restricted-shtuka composite defines z_{m,s,I,f,γ}∈C_c(U_m\G(K)/U_m,Λ). It is independent of the coefficient realization, leg ordering, local FWeil lift and sufficiently increasing Frobenius tuple; it is continuous in γ, compatible in s,m, and its global convolution equals the modular excursion on all compactly supported automorphic functions, at arbitrary additional level away from v.

*Construction.* Represent f by an integral finite-free matrix coefficient and lift γ to local FWeil. Compose creation, ordered partial Frobenius to (mi), Tδ, return partial Frobenius and annihilation, decreasing jet/iteration budgets as required. At zero legs the regular level local system identifies the result with a compactly supported double-coset function. Cartesian correspondence pullback proves the global convolution identity. Use GeL Lemma 1.4’s Poincaré-series detection with arbitrary away-v level to prove uniqueness, hence independence of every auxiliary choice and continuity.

*Remark.* The detection step uses the excursions on full compactly supported cohomology of [§GS.5.4 *Excursions on full compact cohomology*](#gs-5-excursions-on-full-compact-cohomology), in the split case and, for nonsplit G, in the torsion version that target includes. The cuspidal action alone does not suffice.

The API:

- `LocalExcursion.convolution` (constructor): The compactly supported U_m-double-coset element at finite torsion coefficients.
- `LocalExcursion.choiceIndependent` (characterisation): Every permitted finite-jet construction gives the same local function.
- `LocalExcursion.globalAction` (compatibility): Right convolution equals the global excursion on C_c at every auxiliary away-v level.
- `LocalExcursion.coefficientTransition` (functoriality): Reduce s or project the congruence level compatibly.

**Checks.**

- For the two-leg trace function at spherical level, where the prime-to-ℓ convenience is unnecessary, recover h_{V,v}.
- For f=1 recover the identity 1_{U_m} under volume-one convolution.
- Replacing one torsion realization (W,x,ξ) of f or changing a lift δ does not change the double-coset function; this needs the global detection theorem, not a chosen-isomorphism claim.

### GS.7.6 Bernstein centre parameters

The local elements define z_{I,f,γ} in the projective limit over U of the ℓ-adic completions of the integral level Hecke centres, with the algebra, reindexing, three-copy and continuity identities. For an integral smooth admissible irreducible G(K)-representation over a finite Q_ℓ-extension, evaluating its central character reconstructs a continuous semisimple Gal(K̄/K)→Ĝ(Q̄_ℓ) parameter. For an arbitrary such irreducible, one obtains a continuous semisimple Weil(K) parameter by constant-character twisting and normalized parabolic induction. The assignment depends only on its Bernstein central character and respects normalized induction.

*Proof.* Global detection makes each finite-level element central and compatible with level and with reduction of the torsion exponent; take the completed inverse limit. Evaluate on an integral character and use the Weil-continuity clause of the reconstruction (LanglandsParameterStacks §§LP2c.2–LP2c.4). Integral values of the invariants allow conjugation into Ĝ(O_E′), so the representation extends from the Weil group to the profinite Galois group. Prove the Levi constant-term identity (GeL Theorem 1.1(vi)). Twist arbitrary supercuspidals to integral ones and extend through supercuspidal support and normalized parabolic induction. Apply the same detection argument to prove uniqueness and dependence only on the central character.

*Remark.* The initial theorem is for split G; GeL §9 provides the nonsplit finite-L-group adaptation.

*Remark.* An arbitrary nonintegral Weil parameter need not extend continuously to Gal(K̄/K).

*Remark.* Noncompleted Bernstein-centre membership uses the additional comparison cited in GeL Remark 1.2; it is not silently included in the completed-centre proof.

### GS.7.7 Local excursions on compact cohomology

With integral coefficients O_E and arbitrary additional legs J and coefficient V, the local elements z_{m,I,f,γ} = lim_s z_{m,s,I,f,γ} act by right convolution on colim_μ H^{0,≤μ,O_E}_{N,J,V} at the generic point of the diagonal, and this action equals the global excursion on compactly supported shtuka cohomology. The inverse-limit function tends to zero at infinity in the ℓ-adic topology. Finite support of every torsion reduction does not by itself give finite support of the integral limit, and finite support of the limit is not asserted.

*Proof.* Use the integral excursion action on compactly supported cohomology of [§GS.5.4 *Excursions on full compact cohomology*](#gs-5-excursions-on-full-compact-cohomology), with its coefficient and fusion compatibilities. Repeat the cartesian comparison of correspondences with the extra legs J present. Pass through coefficient reduction and the inverse limit, keeping apart finite support at each s and decay at infinity.

*Remark.* For J = ∅ one recovers convolution on compactly supported automorphic functions.

*Remark.* No support bound uniform in s is inferred from the finite torsion construction; GeL Remark 6.3 sketches a stronger argument through Ito's results, without full details, and it is not used.

### GS.7.8 Semisimple local–global compatibility

If π=⊗v πv occurs in a global cusp block Hσ, then at every place v the local Genestier–Lafforgue parameter is Ĝ-conjugate to (σ|Gal(F̄_v/Fv))^ss in the integral case, and to the semisimplified Weil restriction in the wider coefficient case. For nonsplit G use ᴸG_v and its prescribed finite quotient. This is equality of semisimple parameters, with no general monodromy operator and no multiplicity in local L-packets attached.

For nonsplit G this uses the parahoric construction included in [§GS.7.2 *Finite restricted shtukas*](#gs-7-restricted-shtukas-and-the-local-excursion-element).

*Proof.* Restrict the global excursion-convolution identity to Hσ. Its scalar character evaluates every invariant function on the tuple σ(γi), while the local centre character evaluates it on the local reconstructed tuple. Use the all-tuples semisimple character theorem to obtain conjugacy; retain the finite-quotient projection for nonsplit G.

*Remark.* Equality of spherical eigenvalues at good places alone does not prove ramified local–global compatibility.

<a id="gs-7-semisimplification-versus-monodromy"></a>

### GS.7.9 Semisimplification and monodromy

For general G the preceding construction retains the ordinary semisimple local Galois/Weil parameter and cannot in general determine a nilpotent monodromy operator N from πv. For GL_r the full classical local correspondence uses a Frobenius-semisimplified Weil–Deligne pair (r_v,N_v); Frobenius semisimplification retains N_v. Ordinary semisimplification and Frobenius semisimplification must therefore be separate operations and separate comparison statements.

*Proof.* Use the Weil–Deligne parameters of LanglandsParameterStacks §LP1.11 with their monodromy convention. Compare two Weil–Deligne pairs with the same semisimple Weil part and different N: their excursion invariants agree. Use the division-algebra example of GeL Remark 0.3: one local representation of D^× can occur in global representations with different monodromy before semisimplification.

*Remark.* The semisimple theorem gives no ramified Weil–Deligne comparison for general G.

<a id="gs-7-local-gamma-factors"></a>

### GS.7.10 Local gamma factors

For a reductive group over a local function field K, a finite-dimensional representation ρ of its finite L-group, a smooth irreducible representation π and characters χ:K×→Q̄_ℓ× and nontrivial ψ:K→Q̄_ℓ×, define γ(s,ρ,π,χ,ψ) by the Artin local factor of (ρ∘σπ)⊗χ. After coefficient identification with C these rational functions satisfy naturality, direct-sum multiplication, rank-one reciprocity, normalized parabolic induction, the change-of-ψ law, highly ramified stability and the global functional equation. They extend the existing function-field gamma-factor theories in their common ranges. These gamma factors depend only on the semisimple parameter, unlike separate L and epsilon factors in general.

Use the equal-characteristic local constants and function-field product formula of AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3, *Function-field local factors, multiplicity one and converse theorem*, with its residue character, geometric Frobenius and self-dual measure. For a Weil–Deligne representation V put L(s,V)=det(1−q_K^{−s}Frob_K | (ker N)^I)⁻¹ and define `LocalGamma`=ε(s,V,ψ)L(1−s,V∨)/L(s,V). Prove cancellation of the monodromy correction in this quotient, so the factor agrees with that of the semisimplified Weil representation.

The API `LocalGamma.natural`, `LocalGamma.directSum`, `LocalGamma.rankOne`, `LocalGamma.parabolicInduction`, `LocalGamma.changeAdditiveCharacter`, `LocalGamma.stability` and `LocalGamma.functionalEquation` states the seven properties above. For ψ_a(x)=ψ(ax), the change is det(V)(a)|a|^{dim(V)(s−1/2)}, with det(V)(a) read by the fixed geometric reciprocity convention.

*Proof.* Apply the supplied Artin factors to the semisimple local parameter and use its normalized induction compatibility. Verify the seven identities of GeL §7.1, using AL.3's product formula for the global functional equation. For uniqueness globalize supercuspidal data by Poincaré series and isolate the desired place with highly ramified twists. The strengthened globalization cited in GeL Remark 7.1 proves uniqueness without making stability an extra uniqueness axiom.

*Remark.* The rank-one factor is Tate’s local factor with the same reciprocity convention.

*Remark.* Do not deduce ramified L or epsilon factors for general G from the gamma-factor identity.

**Checks.**

- The zero coefficient representation has L=ε=γ=1; the multiplicative unit is not zero.
- For the trivial rank-one character and ψ of conductor zero, with vol(O_K)=1, γ(s,1,ψ)=(1−q_K^{−s})/(1−q_K^{s−1}). The numerator vanishes at s=0 and the denominator does not, since q_K>1. Inverting this quotient reverses the zero and pole.
- For the same character, replacing ψ by ψ(ϖ·) multiplies γ by q_K^{1/2−s}. This fixes the sign of the exponent and includes the change of self-dual measure; for two copies of the character the multiplier is q_K^{1−2s}.

### GS.7.11 The ramified GL_r local comparison

For the global GL_r correspondence of AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3, at every place v the Frobenius-semisimplified Weil–Deligne representation attached to σ_π restricted to Gal(F̄_v/F_v) corresponds to π_v under the local Langlands correspondence for GL_r over F_v (ExcursionOperatorsAndSpectralAction §ES7:equal-characteristic.18), monodromy and all local pair factors included. The local factor π_v is characterized by its central character and its pair factors with all lower-rank cuspidal representations (LL Proposition VII.4), and the comparison follows by induction on r (LL Corollary VII.5).

*Proof.* Apply the all-place pair-factor identities of AL.3 and the local characterization LL Proposition VII.4. Keep N in the Weil–Deligne pair while semisimplifying Frobenius, and induct on the rank.

*Remark.* This comparison does not require that every global shtuka be uniformized by local shtukas.

*Remark.* A cohomological realization of the local correspondence by local shtukas is HeckeStacksAndLocalShtukas §§HS2.9 and HS3.1–HS3.2 with ExcursionOperatorsAndSpectralAction Layer ES7:equal-characteristic; its identification with the restricted-shtuka construction of this layer is not used here.

### Examples

- *Spherical level.* At a hyperspecial place, the local excursion element of the two-leg trace function f(g₁, g₂) = χ_V(g₁g₂⁻¹) and (Frob_v, 1) is the normalized spherical function h_{V,v}; for f = 1 the element is the unit 1_{U_m} ([§GS.7.5 *Local excursion convolution elements*](#gs-7-local-excursion-convolution)).
- *No legs.* With I = ∅ the restricted-shtuka stack is the classifying stack of G(O_{nv}), not a discrete set ([§GS.7.2 *Finite restricted shtukas*](#gs-7-restricted-shtukas-and-the-local-excursion-element)).
- *Monodromy.* The Steinberg representation of GL₂(K) and the trivial character of GL₂(K) have the same semisimple parameter, with Weil part |·|^{1/2} ⊕ |·|^{−1/2}; the Steinberg representation has a nonzero monodromy operator and the trivial character has N = 0, so only the comparison with monodromy distinguishes them ([§GS.7.9 *Semisimplification and monodromy*](#gs-7-semisimplification-versus-monodromy)).
- *Rank one.* For G = G_m the local gamma factor is Tate's local factor of the character, with the same reciprocity convention ([§GS.7.10 *Local gamma factors*](#gs-7-local-gamma-factors)).

## Source corrections

The following points in the sources need care. Each is described in our own words, with the corrected statement used in this roadmap.

- **E1** (YZ, §3.5.4, p. 38 of arXiv v2; the same text is on p. 38 of v1). When the normalized horocycle complex P_κ is recalled at the start of §3.5.4, the shift and twist are written with a minus sign, \[−#I(κ)\](−#I(κ)/2). Corollary 3.29 (p. 35) gives Rπ_{κ!}Q_ℓ = Rπ_{1!}Q_ℓ\[−2r + #I(κ)\](−r + #I(κ)/2), so after the normalization \[2r\](r) the shift and twist are \[+#I(κ)\](+#I(κ)/2); a lisse complex on the #I(κ)-dimensional support is perverse with the positive shift. Used in [§GS.3.3 *Horocycle compact direct images*](#gs-3-horocycle-compact-image).
- **E2** (YZ, §3.5.4, p. 38). The rank-one map on one fixed-degree component is a torsor under Pic⁰_X(k), not under Pic_X(k); only the union of all degree translates is a Pic_X(k)-torsor, because a line bundle of nonzero degree changes the degree component. Used in [§GS.3.9 *PGL₂ boundary constant terms*](#gs-3-pgl2-cohomological-constant-term).
- **E3** (YZ, §3.5.4, p. 38). In the direct sum over the translates κ′ ∈ κ + Z, the summand indexed by κ′ must use the projection for N(κ′), not the fixed projection for N(κ); otherwise the action of Pic_X(k) by translation is lost. Used in [§GS.3.9 *PGL₂ boundary constant terms*](#gs-3-pgl2-cohomological-constant-term).
- **E4** (Feng, §5.2.3, p. 36 of arXiv v6). In the definition of the Frobenius–Weil automorphisms, the subscript names the algebraic closure of F_q, while that paper's curve lives over F_ℓ; the closure of the actual base field is meant. This roadmap uses k = F_q throughout and defines the Frobenius–Weil group through the geometric kernel, as in VL Remark 8.18. Used in [§GS.4.3 *The Frobenius–Weil group*](#gs-4-frobenius-weil-group).
- **E5** (LL, Theorem I.13, pp. 31–32 of the author copy). The author copy corrects the trace formula of the earlier book: the lower-rank error terms are polynomials times exponentials in the iteration exponent, not pure exponentials, and the positive-degree polynomial parts cancel only after comparison with cohomological traces. AutomorphicLFunctionsAndLocalFactors §AL.3 uses this corrected form.
- **E6** (Xue-I, proof of Lemma 8.2.4, p. 55 of arXiv v2). The proof treats A/mⁿ as a finite torsion O_E-module for every maximal ideal m of a finitely generated O_E-algebra A. This fails when λ ∉ m: for A = O_E[t] and m = (λt − 1), A/m = E. The repair separates the two cases. If λ ∈ m, A/m is a finite field and M/mⁿM is a finite torsion O_E-module, so the finite-coefficient Drinfeld lemma applies. If λ ∉ m, λ is invertible on A/mⁿ, A/m is finite over E, and M/mⁿM is a finite-dimensional E-vector space with a stable lattice, so the rational Drinfeld lemma applies. The Krull intersection argument then proceeds as written, and the statement of Proposition 8.2.6 is unaffected. Used in [§GS.4.12 *Weil descent on full cohomology*](#gs-4-full-cohomology-weil-descent).

## Downstream consumers
