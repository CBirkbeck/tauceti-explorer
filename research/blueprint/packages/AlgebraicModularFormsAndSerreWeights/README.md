# Modular forms — Hecke theory, newforms, and L-functions, Part II

## Geometric reduction, Serre weights and eigenvalue lifting

A complex eigenform has an integral system of Hecke eigenvalues, and reducing those eigenvalues at a coefficient prime gives a residual Galois representation. Over a field of positive characteristic there is another source of forms: sections of powers of the Hodge line on a compactified modular curve. These two constructions meet through integral section spaces and their q-expansions. Their meeting is delicate in weight one, at small levels, with torsion coefficients and at the small residual primes. This roadmap develops the geometric comparison, the characteristic-p weight operations, the local weight recipe and the algebraic lifting argument needed to pass between them.

The resulting interfaces serve three purposes. They let a geometric eigenform carry a precisely specified integral reduction witness. They compute the classical Serre weight of a residual representation from its local representation, including the extension class in the wild case. They express residual modularity with an eigenform, a coefficient field, a chosen place and a comparison of semisimple representations. In particular, the final target asks for weight k(ρ̄), conductor level N(ρ̄) and determinant character ε(ρ̄); it is an assertion whose universal proof belongs to ClassicalSerreModularity. Weight and level minimization belong to SerreWeightAndLevelOptimisation, R20.3–R20.5.

### Relation to the analytic roadmap

The existing [ModularForms roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/tree/main/ModularForms) supplies the analytic theory. Its Layer 0 supplies all integer weights, diamonds, character spaces and Eisenstein series; Layer 4 supplies full eigenforms, oldforms, newforms and primitive associates; Layer 8 supplies the integral Hecke algebra, coefficient fields and integral q-expansion lattice, with Layer 8W supplying the separately justified weight-one lattice. Layer 10C supplies the analytic automorphy line and the stabilizer and cusp conventions. Those constructions are used here through their specified interfaces. The addition is the comparison with geometric sections and the positive-characteristic and local arithmetic operations.

ModularCurvesPartII supplies the moduli stack, Hodge line, compactifications, Tate charts, correspondences and Igusa geometry. This roadmap defines forms from those objects, proves the elliptic logarithmic Kodaira–Spencer comparison, constructs the auxiliary curve Fricke map and computes its action on Hodge powers. FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory supplies the general BT₁ Hasse determinant, Raynaud theory, Fontaine–Laffaille functor and extension-sensitive local classification. Here those results specialize to the elliptic Hasse section and to the arithmetic Serre recipe. AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations supplies attachment of representations to forms; ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations supplies conductor, tame characters, finite-field descent and recognition of semisimple representations.

### Conventions

Write X for the actual compactified moduli stack or a specified fine modular curve, ω for its Hodge line and C for the full reduced cusp divisor. An integer power ω^k uses the dual line when k<0. Set M_k(K)=H⁰(X,ω^k⊗K) and S_k(K)=H⁰(X,ω^k(−C)⊗K). When K is a base algebra A, this agrees with H⁰(X_A,ω_A^k) by pullback and the affine projection formula. Coefficient modules need not be flat. A coefficient map is always defined; its being an isomorphism after base change is a separate theorem. Katz sometimes denotes the holomorphic space by S(K,n,k); here S_k always means the cusp space, so that those source notations cannot be confused.

The level is invertible on the smooth integral models. Full level n≥3 gives a fine scheme. Levels one and two use a stack or rigidifying descent, with stabilizers retained. The Hodge line need not descend to the coarse j-line. A cusp condition is restriction to every component of C; a single chosen orbit does not describe the entire boundary.

At a full-level Tate chart write E=Tate(t^n) and q=t^n, with ω_can the canonical invariant differential. Expansion in t and expansion in q have different exponents. In these conventions KS(ω_can²)=n dt/t, and the operator normalized by q d/dq sends t^i to (i/n)t^i. A formula Σm a_m q^m uses the usual integral-exponent parameter. The bounded-denominator application of Calegari–Dimitrov–Tang uses q=e^{πiτ}, so Δ starts at q² there.

Use p for the residual prime, κ for a residue field, O for a DVR, ϖ for a uniformizer and K for its fraction field. In the eigenvalue-lifting layer O is an arbitrary DVR, and K may have positive characteristic. A finite extension L/K may be inseparable; a dominating DVR V in L is required, but finiteness of V as an O-module is not. In the modularity layer O comes from a number-field place over p and the characteristic-zero representation is attached to the selected form at that place.

Let χ̄_p be the residual cyclotomic character, I_p inertia and P_p wild inertia. A local residual representation has finite image in GL₂(F̄_p); its semisimplification can describe tame data, but the full extension is retained for the wild weight recipe. Fundamental characters of niveau two occur as ψ and ψ′=ψ^p. In the reducible wild case α is the exponent on the quotient and β the exponent on the stable line. The Fontaine–Laffaille convention is the contravariant U_S functor, HT(χ_cyc)=+1 and positive filtration degree r contributing χ̄_p^r.

For a homogeneous nonzero mod-p form, w(f) is its least possible weight after removing Hasse factors, equivalently its least weight among equal q-expansions in the appropriate component. Use w(0)=0 only as an explicit total-function convention. Write SS_k for forms on the finite supersingular locus. These sections can be nonzero in negative weight even when global M_k vanishes, and SS_k is distinct from the cusp space S_k.

The star on T_ℓ^* follows Edixhoven's normalization. The integral geometric T_ℓ follows Katz's quotient-level convention. Hecke comparisons specify both the normalization and the level structure. At p, U selects coefficients and V multiplies their indices; V is coefficient-linear and differs from the absolute pth-power map over a field larger than F_p. Claims about a theta eigenform require θf≠0.

### Dependency spine

The six layers below keep their arithmetic identifiers R15.1–R15.6. The integral section comparison in R15.2 supports the lifting application in R15.5. The theta and supersingular arguments in R15.3 support controlled weight changes. R15.4 depends on local Galois and finite-flat theory and supplies the numerical invariant used in R15.6. The abstract algebra of R15.5 can be developed independently of the geometry. The final witness definitions use earlier form interfaces and already attached representations, so early representation attachment does not depend on the final modularity predicate.

### Existing algebra to use

The relevant library baseline is Mathlib `082e2d37e8b0463410cdb532e111cd43d5a66174` and Tau Ceti `f790474821cf4256814db967cb154e7af3d0c369`. Schemes, module presheaves, linear maps, power series, tensor products and matrix representations provide carrier types. The modular stack, its Hodge line and logarithmic connection, GAGA and the residual witness comparisons require the geometric and Galois interfaces named in the layers.

The following declarations are inputs, with their existing hypotheses retained:

| Declaration | Use and hypothesis |
| --- | --- |
| `Algebra.adjoin_le` | A set contained in a subalgebra generates a subalgebra contained in it; applied to the stabilizer of a line. |
| `Algebra.HasGoingDown.of_flat` | Flat commutative algebras have going down. The finite free operator algebra supplies flatness. |
| `Ideal.exists_ideal_le_liesOver_of_le` | For primes p≤q and Q over q, going down supplies P≤Q over p; use the zero prime and the DVR maximal ideal. |
| `TauCeti.integralClosure.isDedekindDomain` | Integral closure of a Dedekind domain in a finite extension of its fraction field is Dedekind, without separability. It does not assert module finiteness of the closure. |
| `IsArtinianRing.isNilpotent_jacobson_bot` | The Jacobson radical of an Artinian ring is nilpotent; in the commutative local case it is the maximal ideal. |
| `IsArtinianRing.localization_artinian` | A localization of a commutative Artinian ring is Artinian. |
| `Module.mem_support_iff_of_finite` | For a finite module, a prime is in its support exactly when it contains its annihilator. Faithfulness therefore gives full support. |
| `TensorProduct.AlgebraTensorModule.map_tmul` | The heterobasic tensor map acts on pure tensors by applying the two maps. Use it to compare actions after scalar extension. |

Finiteness of an operator subalgebra, fraction fields of finite domain algebras, lying over, localization of Dedekind domains, flat tensor inclusions, finite free endomorphism base change and coordinate denominator clearing must connect to their existing library statements. The lifting proof below identifies their mathematical roles rather than introducing competing versions of those foundations.

## Layer R15.1 — Geometric forms and comparison

This layer constructs form spaces from the supplied moduli geometry. All integer weights and all cusps enter at the definition stage, so that later cohomology and duality use the same Hodge line. The fine-level section construction precedes small-level descent; the latter's base-change result uses the integral theorem in R15.2. The analytic comparison and logarithmic Kodaira–Spencer map specify the normalizations subsequently used by Hecke and theta.

### Section spaces and small levels

<a id="target-hodge-bundle-with-tate-curve-normalization"></a>

#### Geometric modular forms

For the compactified moduli family supplied by ModularCurvesPartII, define the section modules

M_k(X_A)=H⁰(X_A,ω_A^k),  M_k(K)=H⁰(X,ω^k⊗K),  k∈ℤ.

Here A is a base algebra and K a module over the integral base. Pullback and the affine projection formula identify the two conventions when K=A. Negative powers use ω∨, and every section is required to extend across C. Full level n≥3, with n invertible on the base, gives the fine-scheme construction; Γ₁(N) and small levels use the moduli stack or its effective descent presentation. Evaluating at a Tate curve with ω_can produces the expansion. The construction takes place on that actual stack: a line on the coarse j-line would discard the stabilizer action and give the wrong odd-weight spaces.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.forms`: M_k(K)=H⁰(X,ω^k⊗K), with ω supplied by the modular-curve owner.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.forms_add`: M_k(K) has its section-module structure; restriction and coefficient maps are linear.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.forms_ext`: Two forms are equal when their sections agree on a cover of the moduli stack.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.forms_weight_zero` (degenerate): On a geometrically connected compactified modular curve over an algebraically closed field, weight-zero forms are precisely constants.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.forms_negative` (degenerate): Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic prime to the level, M_k=0 for k<0.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.forms_odd_low_level` (non-example): At level 1 or 2 with 2 invertible, odd-weight forms vanish because −1 acts as (−1)^k on the Hodge power.

Prerequisites: ModularCurvesPartII `R12.5`; ModularCurvesPartII `R13.3`; ModularCurvesPartII `R13.4a`.

<a id="target-cusp-ideal-section-forms"></a>

#### Cusp forms and the cusp ideal

Define the cusp module by S_k(K)=H⁰(X,ω^k(−C)⊗K). Equivalently it is the kernel of restriction from M_k(K) to H⁰(C,ω^k|_C⊗K), using the full reduced Cartier divisor supplied by the modular-curve geometry. The equivalence uses the exact cusp-ideal sequence, and vanishing at a Tate cusp means zero constant coefficient in its normalized expansion. Inclusion into M_k is linear and injective. This kernel description does not assert that restriction to C is surjective: its cokernel is governed by the subsequent H¹ term.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.cuspForms`: S_k=H⁰(ω^k(−C)).

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.cuspForms_inclusion`: The cusp ideal inclusion induces an injective linear map S_k→M_k.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.cuspForms_iff`: A form is cuspidal iff its restriction to the entire cusp divisor is zero.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.cuspForms_weight_zero` (degenerate): S_0=0 on a connected proper geometric curve with a nonempty cusp divisor.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.delta_section` (computation): At level 1, Δ is a weight-12 cusp form with leading coefficient 1 and order one at the cusp.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.eisenstein_not_cuspidal` (non-example): E₄ at level 1 has constant term 1, so is not a cusp form over ℂ.

<a id="target-coefficient-maps"></a>

#### Functorial coefficient maps

An O-linear map u:K→L induces the O-linear section map H⁰(id⊗u):M_k(K)→M_k(L), and the same construction preserves cusp spaces. It respects identity and composition and carries each Tate coefficient through u. For an O-algebra B there is consequently a canonical B-linear map B⊗_O M_k(O)→M_k(B). Define it without a flatness hypothesis; identify it as an isomorphism only under the appropriate base-change theorem. In particular, the weight-one level-one map in characteristic two need not be onto.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.coefficientMap`: The map on sections induced by a linear coefficient map.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.coefficientMap_id`: M_k(id)=id.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.coefficientMap_comp`: M_k(v∘u)=M_k(v)∘M_k(u).

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.coefficientMap_zero` (degenerate): The zero coefficient map induces the zero map.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.coefficientMap_tate` (compatibility): Every q coefficient is sent by the coefficient map.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.coefficientMap_not_always_iso` (non-example): Reduction at level 1 from ℤ to F₂ is not surjective in weight 1; the Hasse invariant has no lift.

<a id="target-level-one-and-two-by-descent-with-explicit-inverted-primes"></a>

#### Level-one and level-two descent

At level two use invariants of the level-four section space under ker(GL₂(ℤ/4)→GL₂(ℤ/2)). At level one use the fibre product of level-three and level-four spaces over level twelve, with the coefficient localizations included in the transition maps. These are rigidifying descent constructions of sections, not sections of a presumed coarse-space Hodge line.

For k≥1, level-two base change is an isomorphism for every algebra in which 2 is a unit. Its integral source is naturally over ℤ[1/2]. For level one and k≥1, base change is an isomorphism when both 2 and 3 are units, passing through ℤ[1/6]. The relevant group orders are 16 for the level-four mod-two kernel, 96 for GL₂(ℤ/4), and 48 for GL₂(ℤ/3); averaging is used only with the requisite orders invertible. The rigid fine-level base-change theorem of R15.2 provides the input. The automorphism −1 forces odd-weight level-two forms to vanish when 2 is invertible.

The level-one assertion fails without excluding 2 and 3. The Hasse section has weight one in characteristic two and weight two in characteristic three although the corresponding characteristic-zero level-one spaces vanish; multiplying by Δ gives cusp examples in weights 13 and 14. This identifies the stated level-one limitation and makes no corresponding blanket failure assertion for level two.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.formsLevelTwo`: M(K,2,k) is the level-four holomorphic section module invariant under the mod-two kernel in GL₂(ℤ/4).

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.formsLevelOne`: M(K,1,k) is the fibre product of level-three and level-four holomorphic modules over level twelve, with the indicated coefficient localizations.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.formsLevelTwo_baseChange`: M(ℤ[1/2],2,k)⊗R₀≃M(R₀,2,k) for k≥1 and 2 invertible in R₀.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.formsLevelOne_baseChange`: M(ℤ,1,k)⊗R₀≃M(R₀,1,k) for k≥1 and both 2 and 3 invertible in R₀.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.levelOne_E4` (computation): E₄=1+240Σσ₃(m)q^m belongs to the holomorphic module M(ℤ[1/6],1,4).

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.levelOne_baseChange_fails_at_2_3` (non-example): Remark 1.8.2.2: over F₂ or F₃ there are level-one forms that are not reductions of forms over Z (the Hasse invariant of weight 1 over F₂, weight 2 over F₃), so Theorem 1.8.2 fails without inverting 2 and 3.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.levelOne_via_rigid` (compatibility): A level-one form is determined by its images at levels 3 and 4, which agree at level 12.

### Analytic and differential comparisons

<a id="target-all-weight-analytic-comparison"></a>

#### All-weight analytic comparison

Over ℂ identify sections of every integer Hodge power on the algebraic moduli stack with the existing analytic space of holomorphic modular forms. Identify ω^k(−C) with analytic cusp forms, and identify the ε diamond eigenspace with the analytic nebentypus space. The construction combines uniformization and the Hodge automorphy factor with projective coherent GAGA and equivariant descent through a rigidifying cover. Use ModularForms Layer 0 and Layer 10C for the actual analytic carriers and their stabilizer conventions, and ComplexComparisonPartII C2 for GAGA. The comparison commutes with coefficients and Tate expansions. In negative weight both spaces vanish; in weight zero on a connected compactified component they consist of constants. Small-level stabilizers remain in the comparison.

<a id="target-logarithmic-kodaira-spencer"></a>

#### Logarithmic Kodaira–Spencer

Let D be the rank-two relative de Rham bundle of the universal elliptic family, with logarithmic extension, Hodge filtration, Gauss–Manin connection and cup product. The composite

ω → D → D⊗Ω¹(log C) → (D/ω)⊗Ω¹(log C)

is O_X-linear and gives the elliptic Kodaira–Spencer isomorphism. Before trivializing the determinant its consequence is Ω¹(log C)≃det(D)⁻¹⊗ω². Only the supplied cup-product trivialization then identifies Ω¹(log C) with ω² and Ω¹ with ω²(−C). On Tate(t^n) the chosen normalization is KS(ω_can²)=n dt/t. The isogeny compatibility includes the degree scalar and the correct source and target level structures. AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A4 supplies D, filtration, connection and cup product; AutomorphicBundles B3 supplies their logarithmic extension. This layer proves the elliptic comparison from those inputs.

<a id="layer-r15-2"></a>

## Layer R15.2 — Integral q-expansion and coherent Hecke theory

The q-expansion map detects geometric sections and descends their coefficients. It does not by itself identify every positive-characteristic section with an integral classical reduction. Finite generation, base change, cusp cohomology and integral character projectors supply the precise comparison. Coherent Hecke operations then act on arbitrary coefficient modules, including torsion. Their action on the whole cusp divisor is calculated by cusp type.

### Detection, coefficient descent and base change

<a id="target-q-expansion-principle-and-its-vanishing-theorem"></a>

#### The q-expansion principle

For full level n≥3 and any ℤ[1/n]-module K, a form is zero if its expansion is zero at one cusp on each geometric connected component. There are φ(n) such components after adjoining ζ_n, so one arbitrary cusp cannot silently replace the required family. If L⊂K is a coefficient submodule and those expansions have all coefficients in L⊗ℤ[1/n,ζ_n], then the form comes from L. No flatness of L or K/L is required. At levels one and two the rigidifying descent descriptions give the corresponding principle with a single cusp.

The proof passes from arbitrary modules through filtered colimits to noetherian data, uses faithful flatness of completion and formal functions at the cusp, and then uses Krull intersection and the depth-zero support argument on the smooth curve over an Artin base. Those exact completion and coherent-cohomology interfaces belong to the foundational input. The result is geometric; the existing analytic injectivity theorem over ℂ is its comparison specialization.

<a id="target-strong-q-expansion-principle-with-its-divisibility-hypothesis"></a>

#### The strong q-expansion principle

Let n,k≥1, and let K be a ℤ[1/n]-module on which multiplication by each prime p satisfying (p−1)∣k is injective. A weight-k form whose expansion at every cusp is a polynomial is zero. Let a be the product of those finitely many primes. If K is a ℤ[1/an]-module and L⊂K is a submodule over that ring, then expansions whose coefficients lie in L at all cusps except for finitely many coefficients already define a form with coefficients in L.

The weight-dependent injectivity assumption is essential. In characteristic p the Hasse section supplies a nonzero constant expansion when its weight p−1 divides the weight in question. The proof needs the ordinary-tower statement that a positive-weight constant expansion vanishes when (p−1) does not divide its weight; it also needs characteristic-zero constant-expansion vanishing, obtained by finite-data descent to a field embeddable in ℂ and the analytic comparison. The reduction of arbitrary coefficient modules to the Artin-local field argument is part of this proof. Polynomiality is required at every cusp.

<a id="target-base-change-for-spaces-of-forms-and-the-weight-one-boundary"></a>

#### Holomorphic base change

For full level n≥3 the canonical coefficient map is an isomorphism for k≥2 and arbitrary coefficient modules. It is also an isomorphism in weight one when 3≤n≤11. The proof uses proper coherent base change and H¹(ω^k)=0, deduced from the curve degree inequality deg(ω^k)>2g−2 and Serre duality; the low-level weight-one range requires the cusp-count and degree calculation. For n≥12 this theorem supplies no general weight-one isomorphism. Cusp twists and character projectors have their own cohomology and integrality conditions, so they do not follow automatically from holomorphic fine-level base change.

<a id="target-finite-generation-of-geometric-sections"></a>

#### Finite section modules

On a proper fine modular curve over a noetherian base, the coherent Hodge-power section module is finite. Over a DVR with X flat, the section module of the invertible Hodge sheaf is torsion-free; finite generation then makes it finite free. Rigidifying descent gives the stack and small-level module as the relevant equalizer or invariant module. A flat coefficient extension has the expected H⁰ base-change comparison. These conclusions use proper coherent finiteness and the specified descent data and do not imply an arbitrary nonflat base-change isomorphism.

### Hecke operators and the classical integral lattice

<a id="target-integral-hecke-operators-from-q-expansions"></a>

#### Integral geometric Hecke operators

For a prime ℓ∤n that is a unit on the initial base, define Katz's geometric operator by summing over the ℓ+1 subgroups H of order ℓ:

(T_ℓf)(E,ω,α)=ℓ^(k−1) Σ_H f(E/H,π̌*ω,π(α)).

Use the quotient level structure π(α), characterized by π∘α=π(α)∘π. The other natural level structure obtained using the dual isogeny differs by multiplication by ℓ and gives a diamond twist. If the expansion at a full-level Tate chart is Σa_i(α)t^i, its coefficients after T_ℓ are

b_i(α)=ℓ^(k−1)a_(i/ℓ)(α′)+a_(ℓi)(α″),

with the first coefficient zero when ℓ∤i. The first level structure α′ is obtained through the μ_ℓ quotient and t↦t^ℓ; the second α″ comes from the cyclic quotient over t^(1/ℓ), followed by the scalar extension returning to the Tate chart. The two level structures must remain visible rather than being replaced by a single arbitrary series.

The operator preserves holomorphy, cusp forms and polynomial expansions. The q-expansion principle and base change extend it uniquely to every ℤ[1/n]-module K when (n≥2 and k≥2) or (3≤n≤11 and k≥1), for all primes ℓ∤n, including residue-characteristic ℓ. At level one the same extension is valid for k≥2 and any ℤ-module K. A prime dividing the level is outside this particular quotient formula; the relevant U correspondence has its own supplied definition.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.heckeT`: T_l for l ∤ n invertible in R, by (1.11.0.2): l^{k−1} ∑_H f(E/H, π̌^*ω, π(α_n)).

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.heckeT_qExpansion`: b_i(α_n) = l^{k−1} a_{i/l}(α′_n) + a_{li}(α″_n) (Formula 1.11.1).

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.heckeT_integral`: For ℓ prime to n, the operator extends to every ℤ[1/n]-coefficient module when n≥2,k≥2 or 3≤n≤11,k≥1 (Proposition 1.11.3); at level one it extends to every ℤ-module for k≥2 (Corollary 1.11.4).

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.heckeT_delta` (computation): For Δ and l = 2: b₁ = a₂ = τ(2) = −24, so T₂Δ = −24Δ.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.heckeT_other_normalisation` (non-example): Using the level structure α_n ∘ π̌ = l·π(α_n) instead of π(α_n) gives the operator twisted by the diamond operator ⟨l⟩, not T_l.

- `TauCeti.KatzModularForms.heckeT_level_divisible` (degenerate): For l | n the formula is not defined (l must be prime to the level); U_l is a different operator.

#### Comparison of integral Hecke algebras

Compare the geometric operators on the finite integral lattice with the integral analytic Hecke algebra of ModularForms Layer 8, using the all-weight analytic and all-cusp integral comparisons. Import its generators and finiteness, with the separate Layer 8W lattice in weight one. DDT Lemma 4.1 is used only in its weight-two Γ_H(N) setting; its branch (b) requires the parameter D to be odd or 2 to be a unit in R. That lemma's hypotheses do not give a new unrestricted algebra construction for all weights. The comparison transfers the owned algebra, rather than rebuilding its analytic foundations.

<a id="target-integral-lattice-and-reduction-image"></a>

#### The integral cusp lattice and its reduction image

Let O be the localization of a number-field integer ring at a place λ over p, with p∤N. Choose an integral lift of the diamond character, and assume that its projector is integral. Take the character part of L=H⁰(X_O,ω^k(−C)); compare it with the analytic all-cusp integral lattice through the actual moduli family and Tate trivializations. Define the reduction space as

S_red=im(L/λL → S_k(X_κ)).

Its definition retains the map from the lattice, rather than identifying its image with every Katz cusp form. If H¹ of the cusp sheaf has no λ-torsion, reduction is onto in the setting with the stated integral character projector. Fine-level holomorphic base change in k≥2, or k=1 with 3≤n≤11, does not establish that claim for every cusp twist, stabilizer invariant or nonintegral character projector. The weight-13 characteristic-two form AΔ gives a concrete level-one obstruction to a universal same-weight assertion.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.modpCuspForms`: S_red is the image of the integral cusp lattice reduction map.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.modpCuspForms_mem`: Membership means a preimage in L/λL.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.modpCuspForms_baseChange`: Scalar extension maps the reduction image to the reduction image of the extended lattice.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.modpCuspForms_zero` (degenerate): The reduction image of a zero cusp lattice is zero.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.katz_vs_reduction` (non-example): At level 1, AΔ has weight 13 in characteristic 2 and is a nonzero Katz cusp form although the characteristic-zero weight-13 space is zero.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.reduced_delta` (computation): At any residue characteristic, integral Δ reduces to a nonzero series with coefficient a₁=1.

<a id="target-bounded-denominators-congruence-application"></a>

#### All-prime bounded denominators

A holomorphic congruence modular form with rational Fourier coefficients admits one integer D≥1 clearing every coefficient denominator, including denominators at primes dividing its level. Use the all-prime bounded-denominator theorem and lattice from the analytic ModularForms roadmap, and compare that lattice with geometric sections using the actual integral models. The smooth ℤ[1/N] model alone cannot control the power of a denominator prime dividing N.

For a modular function f holomorphic on Y(2N), choose m so fΔ^m is holomorphic at all cusps, clear that holomorphic form's denominators, and multiply its expansion by the integral Laurent series Δ⁻m. In the parameter q=e^{πiτ} used in the application, Δ⁻¹=q⁻²∏_(j≥1)(1−q^(2j))⁻²⁴. This yields the single denominator bound for f as a Laurent series. The input includes the level-prime integral comparison; it is not deduced merely by inverting those primes.

### Diamonds, correspondences and Fricke maps

<a id="target-diamond-cohomology-action"></a>

#### Diamonds on coherent cohomology

For the supplied compactified fine auxiliary curve, the actual level action defines diamonds on H^i(X,ω^n⊗A), H^i(X,ω^n(−C)⊗A) and the boundary, for n∈ℤ, i=0,1 and any O-module A. They satisfy the group law, commute with coefficient maps and preserve the cusp sequence. Their action at i=0 compares with the analytic diamonds. The element −1 acts by (−1)^n; thus parity belongs to the Hodge action, including negative powers and torsion coefficients.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.diamond`: The diamond endomorphism on each listed cohomology group.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.diamond_one`: ⟨1⟩=id.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.diamond_mul`: ⟨ab⟩=⟨a⟩∘⟨b⟩.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.diamond_cusp` (compatibility): Restriction to the cusp divisor commutes with diamonds.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.diamond_torsion` (compatibility): Reduction of ⟨a⟩ modulo varpi^m agrees with its coefficient action there.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.diamond_minus_one` (characterisation): ⟨−1⟩ on a weight-n form is multiplication by (−1)^n.

<a id="target-torsion-cohomology-hecke-action"></a>

#### Hecke on torsion coherent cohomology

Work in the Calegari–Geraghty fine-curve setting: p is odd, N≥5, p∤N, Q is squarefree with p∤NQ, and X_Δ(Q) is the specified fine quotient over a DVR O of residue characteristic p. For a prime x∤pNQ and L=ω^n or ω^n(−C), n∈ℤ, define on H^i(X,L⊗A), i=0,1 and every O-module A,

xT_x=tr(π₁)∘(φ*)^⊗n∘π₂*.

The inverse Hodge isogeny map supplies negative powers, since x is a unit. For y∣Q use the analogous U_y correspondence with the forbidden subgroup omitted. The compactified projections, isogeny maps and trace belong to ModularCurvesPartII. The operators recover section and analytic Hecke at i=0, commute with coefficient maps, diamonds and one another, and yield the corresponding O[group]-polynomial algebra action. Torsion coefficients remain legitimate; no assertion that the operator image is torsion-free is used.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.heckeCohomology`: T_x on the specified coherent cohomology, with integral invertible-x normalization.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.heckeCohomology_coefficients`: Coefficient maps intertwine T_x and U_y.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.heckeCohomology_commute`: The allowed T_x,U_y and diamonds commute.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.heckeCohomology_sections` (compatibility): At i=0 the operator is the geometric q-expansion Hecke operator.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.heckeCohomology_boundary` (computation): A nonzero boundary common eigenvector supported on the diamond orbit of ∞, with character ε, has T_x-eigenvalue 1+ε(x)x^{n−1}. The unrestricted all-cusp assertion is false; see the two-character boundary calculation below.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.heckeCohomology_zero_coefficients` (degenerate): Zero coefficient module has zero cohomology and zero operator.

<a id="target-curve-fricke-map"></a>

#### The auxiliary curve Fricke map

On the auxiliary curve with Γ₀(x) data, construct the map on elliptic tuples

w_x(E,α,C_x)=(E/C_x,π∘α,E[x]/C_x).

The quotient/contraction interface of ModularCurvesPartII R13.4b extends it across compactification and the compatible Δ quotient. If π₁,π₂ are the degeneracy maps, prove π₁∘w_x=π₂ and w_x²=⟨x⟩. The double quotient sends the level structure through multiplication by x; omitting that change would incorrectly call w_x an involution. A generic N=5,x=2 point with 2P≠±P tests the distinction. The supplier provides the extension of the quotient geometry; this layer constructs w_x and proves these identities.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.curveFricke`: The compactified map w_x induced by quotienting the auxiliary subgroup.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.curveFricke_sq`: w_x composed twice is the curve diamond map ⟨x⟩.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.curveFricke_projection`: π₁∘w_x=π₂.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.curveFricke_quotient` (computation): For an ordinary geometric point (E,α,C_x), forgetting the subgroup after w_x gives (E/C_x,π∘α), the second projection.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.curveFricke_double` (compatibility): For the same point, quotienting twice gives (E,xα,C_x) under E/E[x]≅E; the subgroup and level structure must both be tracked.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.curveFricke_not_involution` (non-example): On a fine level with a geometric point moved by ⟨x⟩, w_x² is not identity. For example take N=5, Q=1, Δ trivial, x=2 and a generic elliptic curve with only ±1 automorphisms: 2P is neither P nor −P for P of order5.

<a id="target-fricke-hodge-action"></a>

#### Fricke on Hodge powers

Pull back along w_x and combine it with the quotient isogeny's differential map to define W_x on each integer Hodge-power cohomology module with arbitrary coefficients. The square relation is

W_x²=x^n⟨x⟩ on weight n.

The diamond comes from the curve square, and x^n comes from the double-isogeny differential [x] on ω. This accounts for positive, zero and negative weights, and the action is natural in coefficients. The weight-zero square is the diamond alone; weight one adds x. A weight-two square x² times a nontrivial scalar or diamond action is not an involution.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.fricke`: The Hodge-power operator W_x induced by the constructed curve map w_x.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.fricke_sq`: W_x²=x^n⟨x⟩.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.fricke_coefficients`: W_x commutes with coefficient maps.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.fricke_weight_zero` (degenerate): At n=0, W_x²=⟨x⟩.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.fricke_weight_one` (computation): At n=1, W_x²=x⟨x⟩.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.fricke_not_involution` (non-example): At weight 2 and trivial diamond character, W_x²=x² id; over characteristic zero it is not an involution.

### Cuspidal cohomology and boundary eigenvalues

<a id="target-cuspidal-exact-sequence-equivariance"></a>

#### The equivariant cuspidal sequence

Start from 0→ω^n(−C)→ω^n→ω^n|_C→0. In the fine integral curve setting the cusp quotient is O-flat, so tensoring with any O-module A gives the required exact sequence and its coherent-cohomology long exact sequence. Diamonds and allowed Hecke correspondences commute with inclusion, restriction and the connecting maps, using their actual cusp-preserving geometry and trace. This permits localization of the entire sequence at a common eigensystem; it does not require restriction in degree zero to be onto.

<a id="target-boundary-eigensystems-are-eisenstein"></a>

#### Eisenstein boundary eigensystems

In the fine auxiliary-curve setting of the torsion coherent Hecke action, pass to the residue field and consider a simultaneous good-prime Hecke and diamond eigensystem on H⁰(C,ω^n|_C). Its eigenvalues have the form

a_x=ψ₁(x)+ψ₂(x)x^(n−1),  ψ₁ψ₂=ε,

where ψ₁ and ψ₂ are finite-order prime-to-p characters and ε is the diamond character. The associated semisimple representation is ψ₁⊕ψ₂χ̄_p^(n−1). Compute this with the full finite cusp-type decomposition and its actual Tate level structures. On the diamond orbit of infinity the formula specializes to 1+ε(x)x^(n−1); over zero it is ε(x)+x^(n−1). Other cusp types can have both characters nontrivial, and an eigenvector can be zero on entire other orbits.

Consequently the boundary term vanishes upon localization at an absolutely irreducible residual eigensystem, using semisimple characteristic-polynomial recognition. The unrestricted single-orbit formula in CG18 Remark 3.4 is insufficient for the full boundary. The conclusion uses the character decomposition, not diamond transitivity on all cusps.

<a id="layer-r15-3"></a>

## Layer R15.3 — Hasse, theta and weight operations

In characteristic p the Hasse section changes weight without changing its q-expansion, while theta changes Hecke eigenvalues by a cyclotomic factor. The Igusa interpretation fixes their geometric meaning. Weight reduction uses finite supersingular sections, their twisted periodicity and the cohomological boundary map; no semisimplicity of the Hecke action is assumed. Small-prime tables and torsion weight-one operators are stated separately from the generic case.

### The Hasse section and differential operations

<a id="target-hasse-invariant-as-a-form-of-weight-p-minus-one"></a>

#### The elliptic Hasse invariant

For an elliptic curve in characteristic p, choose an invariant differential ω and the Serre-dual basis η of H¹(O_E). Absolute Frobenius acts p-linearly by F(η)=A(E,ω)η. Replacing ω by λω multiplies that scalar by λ^(1−p), so it defines a section A of ω^(p−1). The Tate expansion is 1. Compare this elliptic section with the imported general BT₁ determinant(V*) construction, keeping the determinant-line and dual-Frobenius conventions. The general Hasse determinant remains owned by R07.2. The mod-five E₄ expansion, the failure of a level-one characteristic-two weight-one lift, and filtration zero of the expansion 1 test the specialization.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.hasseInvariant`: A(E, ω) ∈ R defined by F_abs(η) = A(E, ω)η, η dual to ω, for E over an F_p-algebra R.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.hasseInvariant_weight`: A(E, λω) = λ^{1−p}A(E, ω): A is a level-one form of weight p − 1 over F_p.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.hasseInvariant_tate`: A(Tate(q), ω_can) = 1.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.hasse_E4_mod5` (computation): At p=5 the weight-four Hasse section equals E₄ modulo 5 by the q-expansion principle; its coefficient check is 5∣240.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.hasse_no_level_one_lift_p2` (non-example): In characteristic two A has no holomorphic level-one lift over ℚ∩ℤ₂ in weight one. Fine-level lifting in odd 3≤n≤11 and its pullbacks to multiples are stated separately above.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.hasse_weight_zero_filtration` (degenerate): A has q-expansion 1, the q-expansion of the constant form of weight 0, so its filtration is w(A) = 0.

<a id="target-deligne-congruence-and-the-explicit-p-equals-2-3-liftings"></a>

#### Deligne congruence and small-prime lifts

Use the analytic normalized Eisenstein series E_k=1−(2k/B_k)Σ_(m≥1)σ_(k−1)(m)q^m for even k≥4. For p≥5 the coefficient multiplier −2(p−1)/B_(p−1) has p-adic valuation one. Thus E_(p−1) is p-integral and reduces to the Hasse section A by equality of weight and q-expansion. The Bernoulli integrality input is required independently of geometric base change.

For p=2 or 3 the Hasse section has no holomorphic level-one characteristic-zero lift in its own weight. In characteristic two, fine-level weight-one base change produces lifts for odd 3≤n≤11; pullback supplies levels divisible by 3,5,7 or 11. This statement makes no general lifting claim for the other odd levels. In characteristic three, weight-two lifts exist for all n≥2 prime to 3, with n=2 using the level-two theorem. The level-one integral E₄ instead lifts A⁴ at p=2 and A² at p=3. The powers, weights and level hypotheses remain distinct.

<a id="target-theta-operator-filtration-and-hecke-commutation"></a>

#### Theta and filtration

Let M(N)=⊕_(k≥0)M_k(N,F̄_p), with p∤N. For nonzero homogeneous f of weight k define w(f) as the least weight k−i(p−1) for which f is divisible by A^i. Equivalently it is the smallest weight admitting the same expansion on the relevant component; this uses the graded expansion kernel (A−1) and the componentwise q-expansion principle. Define w(0)=0 separately if a total function is needed.

Construct a derivation θ of degree p+1 whose normalized expansion is q d/dq. If w(f)=k and p∤k, then w(θf)=k+p+1. If f has weight pk and θf=0, then f=g^p for a unique weight-k form g over F̄_p. On Tate(t^n), θ(t^i)=(i/n)t^i, agreeing with KS(ω_can²)=n dt/t; this does not identify the parameters t and q.

In Edixhoven's normalization T_ℓ^*θ=ℓθT_ℓ^*, including T_p^*θ=0. For θf≠0, an eigenform of type (N,k,ε) with eigenvalues a_ℓ becomes one of type (N,k+p+1,ε) with eigenvalues ℓa_ℓ. Once the representations have been attached by R19, semisimple recognition gives ρ_(θf)≃ρ_f⊗χ̄_p. Attachment is needed for this consequence, not for constructing θ.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.filtration`: w(f) = min{k − i(p − 1) : f ∈ A^i M(N, k − i(p − 1))}.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.theta`: The derivation θ : M(N) → M(N) of degree p + 1 acting by q d/dq on every q-expansion.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.theta_filtration`: If w(f) = k and p ∤ k then w(θf) = k + p + 1.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.theta_hecke`: T_l^*(θf) = l θ(T_l^* f); hence ρ_{θf} = ρ_f ⊗ χ for an eigenform f.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.theta_qexp` (computation): θ(∑a_nq^n) = ∑ n a_n q^n; for Δ mod 5 the coefficient of q² in θΔ is 2·τ(2) = −48 ≡ 2 (checked in the suggested Lean file).

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.theta_kills_pth_powers` (non-example): θ(g^p) = 0 although g^p ≠ 0: θ is not injective, and the kernel in weight pk consists of p-th powers.

#### Coefficient-linear U and V

On expansions define coefficient-linear V by V(Σa_mq^m)=Σa_mq^(pm), and formal U by U(Σa_mq^m)=Σa_(pm)q^m. Then UV=1 for p>0. Absolute Frobenius instead sends f to f^p, with coefficients a_m^p. These maps coincide only under the appropriate coefficient restriction; the field F₂(t) distinguishes them immediately. The geometric meaning of the form operations uses relative Frobenius and Verschiebung of elliptic curves and the actual modular correspondence.

The Hecke formula is T_p=U+p^(k−1)⟨p⟩V. In characteristic p it reduces to U for k≥2, while in weight one it remains U+⟨p⟩V. Defining U on arbitrary series is not a proof that it preserves a specified geometric form space; that assertion uses its correspondence or the weight-one construction.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.qU`: The coefficient-selection linear map on formal power series.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.qV`: The exponent-multiplication linear map on formal power series.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.qU_qV`: qU(p)(qV(p)(f))=f for p>0.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.qV_coefficient`: The coefficient at m is a_{m/p} if p|m, and zero otherwise.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.qV_X` (computation): V(q)=q^p and U(q^p)=q.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.qV_linear_not_power` (non-example): Over F₂(t), V(tq)=tq² while (tq)²=t²q².

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.qU_constant` (degenerate): U fixes constants; V also fixes constants.

<a id="target-igusa-interpretation-of-hasse-and-theta"></a>

#### The Igusa interpretation

On the ordinary Igusa cover the tautological invariant differential a trivializes ω and satisfies a^(p−1)=A. A weight-k form divided by a^k has the inverse kth-power deck character. The unit-root splitting of de Rham cohomology and the normalized Kodaira–Spencer map define the ordinary differential operator. Multiplication by A extends it across the Hasse divisor to θ on the compactified form spaces. The tower, its monodromy and the tautological differential come from ModularCurvesPartII R13.5; the form and deck-character comparisons are this layer's specialization. The small-prime construction uses that geometry and does not divide by 6.

### Ordinary weight congruences and weight one

<a id="target-weight-congruences-on-the-ordinary-tower"></a>

#### Ordinary weight congruences

On the ordinary tower modulo p^m, m≥1, a weight-k form with expansion 1 is horizontal exactly when D_(p,m) divides k, where

D_(p,m)=(p−1)p^(m−1) for odd p,

D_(2,1)=1, D_(2,2)=2, D_(2,m)=2^(m−2) for m≥3.

If two weights give congruent expansions and at least one coefficient is nonzero modulo p, their weights are congruent modulo this divisor. After identifying the horizontal section, the equality is checked on every component through a tested cusp. Use the full unit-group monodromy of the ordinary Igusa tower. In particular the dyadic exponent is not obtained by substituting p=2 in the odd-prime formula.

<a id="target-weight-one-tp-with-torsion-coefficients"></a>

#### Weight-one T_p with torsion coefficients

Take p≥3, N≥5 with p∤N, and coefficients O/ϖ^m. The geometric weight-one T_p, using the coefficient-general construction required from Gross's operator, has expansion U+⟨p⟩V. Choose an integral Hasse power A_m congruent to 1 modulo ϖ^m and high enough to reach weight k′ for which p^(k′−1) and the required cyclotomic-power differences vanish modulo ϖ^m. Multiplication gives φ into that one high-weight space. The two doubling maps are φ and φT_p−U_highφ; the second has expansion ⟨p⟩Vf, and both maps have the same target Hodge weight.

Theta kills the V contribution, and theta is injective in weights 1 through p−2 in the stated geometric setting. The formal series equation alone does not construct T_p over torsion coefficients: preservation of the actual section space, its level and coefficient hypotheses must be supplied. The GL₂ weight-one argument here is distinct from the higher-dimensional symplectic result.

### Supersingular sections, Fricke and duality

<a id="target-supersingular-section-space"></a>

#### Supersingular section spaces

Let p∤N, N≥5, and work over F̄_p. The elliptic Hasse zero locus Z⊂X₁(N) is finite and reduced, with each zero simple; prime-to-p isogenies preserve it. For every k∈ℤ define

SS_k=H⁰(Z,ω^k|_Z)≃⊕_(z∈Z)ω_z^k.

Evaluation at each point gives extensionality. Restriction of global forms and the fibrewise tensor-product identifications define the restriction and multiplication maps. The Hecke action is induced from the restricted prime-to-p correspondences. The exact sheaf sequence is 0→ω^(k−p+1)→ω^k→ω^k|_Z→0, with the first map multiplication by A. For empty Z the space is zero; for a nonempty locus negative-weight fibres still have sections, and weight-zero sections are arbitrary functions on Z rather than only constants. The simple-zero geometry is supplied by R13.5, not inferred from the formal direct-sum carrier.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularForms`: SS_k is the section module of ω^k on the actual finite reduced supersingular locus, with evaluation at each point.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularForms_eval`: The K-linear evaluation SS_k→ω_x^k is the x-component of its finite direct-sum description.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularForms_ext`: Two supersingular sections are equal iff their values at every supersingular point agree.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularRestriction`: Restricting a global modular form evaluates it on the actual Hodge fibres at all supersingular points; the map is linear.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularForms_mul`: Pointwise tensor product gives SS_a×SS_b→SS_(a+b) using the Hodge-power identifications; multiplication by a fixed section is linear and detected on every fibre.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularForms_empty` (degenerate): Restriction to an empty finite locus has the zero section space, rather than a copy of the coefficient field.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularForms_weight_zero` (computation): At weight zero, two distinct supersingular points allow different values; the space is all functions on the finite set, not just constants.

- `TauCeti.ModPModularForms.supersingularForms_negative` (non-example): On a nonempty finite supersingular locus every Hodge power, including negative weights, has a nonzero section after fibre trivializations; this contrasts with global negative-weight forms.

<a id="target-supersingular-hecke-twisted-periodicity"></a>

#### Twisted supersingular periodicity

Differentiate the Hasse section to first order at its simple zero divisor and use Kodaira–Spencer to obtain a nowhere-zero B∈SS_(p+1). Multiplication by B identifies SS_k with SS_(k+p+1) for every integer k, and satisfies

T_ℓ(Bf)=ℓ B T_ℓ(f),  ℓ≠p.

Hence multiplication by B^(p−1) gives a Hecke-equivariant period p²−1. The weight-(p+1) comparison has a Hecke twist, and B is a section only on the supersingular points; no global form with constant expansion 1 is asserted. The construction uses the simple Hasse divisor, its restricted line and the isogeny compatibility of KS.

<a id="target-edixhoven-root-fricke-operator"></a>

#### The root-dependent Hodge Fricke operator

After extending O to contain ζ_(NQ), use the supplied root-dependent curve map w_ζ and its universal NQ-isogeny. Combine curve pullback with the isogeny differential on integer Hodge powers to define W_ζ on the actual cohomology modules, respecting the Δ quotient. It is natural in all coefficient modules, including O/ϖ^m and K/O, and has a dual action by precomposition λ↦λ∘W_ζ. At weight zero the Hodge factor is the identity and the operation is curve pullback. Its dual evaluation identity fixes the convention needed by the twisted duality below. The curve construction is imported; this target supplies the Hodge and coefficient-module action.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.rootFricke`: Section pullback by w_ζ followed by the universal isogeny map on ω^n.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.rootFricke_coefficients`: W_ζ commutes with natural maps of coefficient modules.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.rootFricke_dual`: The action on a functional λ is λ∘W_ζ.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.rootFricke_weight_zero` (degenerate): At weight0 the isogeny map on the trivial line is identity, so W_ζ is curve pullback.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.rootFricke_torsion` (compatibility): The coefficient square commutes after O→O/varpi^m and after O→K/O; flatness of these coefficient modules is not assumed.

- `TauCeti.GeometricHecke.rootFricke_dual_evaluation` (computation): Evaluate the contragredient operator at a form: W_ζ^∨λ(f)=λ(W_ζ f). This is the action inserted in twisted Serre duality.

<a id="target-twisted-serre-duality-hecke"></a>

#### Twisted duality and the supersingular boundary

In the fine X_Δ(Q) setting, enlarge O to contain ζ_(NQ). Under the relative coherent Serre-duality and finite-free/base-change hypotheses, combine duality with KS and the dual Hodge action W_ζ to obtain

Φ:H¹(X,ω^(2−n)(−C)⊗K/O) ≃ Hom_O(H⁰(X,ω^n),K/O).

Its twisted Hecke identity is ΦT_x=x^(1−n)T_x∨Φ, with the same identity for the allowed U_x, and Φ⟨a⟩=⟨a⟩∨Φ in this convention. The scalar is 1 when n=1. Bare Serre duality does not supply these identities. SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.2 supplies proper adjunction and trace; SF.3 supplies the relative K/O duality and correspondence functoriality, which cannot be replaced by field-only Serre duality.

For the Hasse sequence over F̄_p, the connecting map and the twisted comparison give Φ:SS_k→S_(p+1−k)∨ and an exact sequence M_k→SS_k→S_(p+1−k)∨. Here the cusp twist belongs on the dual target, and Φ need not be an isomorphism. The relation is ΦT_ℓ=ℓ^(k−1)T_ℓ∨Φ. This is the supersingular boundary input to weight reduction.

### Theta cycles and weight reduction

<a id="target-theta-cycles-and-the-small-characteristic-tables"></a>

#### Theta cycles

For homogeneous f with θf≠0, define its theta cycle as (w(θf),…,w(θ^(p−1)f)). For p>3 the general shapes, up to cyclic permutation, are

* (h,h+(p+1),…,h+(p−2)(p+1)), with h≡2 mod p;
* (h,h+(p+1),…,h+(p−h₀)(p+1),h₁,h₁+(p+1),…,h₁+(h₀−3)(p+1)), with h≡h₀ mod p, 3≤h₀≤(p+3)/2 and h₁=h+p+3−2h₀.

For p=2 the single entry is even. For p=3 the possible shapes are (h,h+4) with h≡2 mod 3 or (h,h) with h≡0 mod 3. These are separate small-prime statements.

For a cuspidal eigenform of type (N,k,ε), require 1≤k≤p+1, w(f)=k and θf≠0. The following table gives the full p>3 cycle. Write P(a,r)=(a,a+(p+1),…,a+(r−1)(p+1)), interpreting r=0 as the empty list, and use concatenation in the entries.

| a_p | k | Cycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | P(p+2,p−1) |
| 0 | 2 | P(p+3,p−2), then 2 |
| 0 | 3≤k≤p−1 | P(k+p+1,p−k), then P(p+3−k,k−2), then k |
| 0 | p | P(3,p−2), then p |
| 0 | p+1 | Does not occur under these hypotheses |
| nonzero | 1 or p | P(p+2,p−1) |
| nonzero | 2≤k≤p−1 | P(k+p+1,p−k), then P(2p+2−k,k−1) |
| nonzero | p+1 | P(2p+2,p−1) |

The explicit small-characteristic eigenform tables are:

| p | k | a_p=0 | a_p≠0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 1 | (4) | (4) |
| 2 | 2 | (2) | (4) |
| 2 | 3 | Does not occur | (6) |
| 3 | 1 | (5,9) | (5,9) |
| 3 | 2 | (6,2) | (6,6) |
| 3 | 3 | (3,3) | (5,9) |
| 3 | 4 | Does not occur | (8,12) |

The proof interface includes the general theta-cycle argument cited to Jochnowitz §7 and the filtration drop calculation, in addition to the geometric theta construction. Evaluating a finite list of integers alone does not prove that an actual eigenform has that cycle.

<a id="target-weight-reduction-to-at-most-p-plus-one"></a>

#### Weight reduction to at most p+1

For an eigenform f of type (N,k,ε), with p∤N, find an eigenform g of type (N,k′,ε) and an integer 0≤i≤p−1 such that k′≤p+1 and f and θ^ig have the same T_ℓ^* eigenvalues away from p. The claim controls that good-prime eigensystem, not its T_p eigenvalue.

At N≥5 the proof uses the Hasse cohomology sequence, the weight-(p+1) supersingular periodicity with its Hecke twist and the boundary comparison SS_k→S_(p+1−k)∨. To extract eigenvectors, use support over the finite-dimensional commutative image algebra and its preservation by field duality; a semisimple Hecke action is unnecessary. Smaller levels are obtained through rigidifying covers and G-invariants only when p∤#G. The exceptional N=1,p=2,3 cases require Serre's theorem in Astérisque 24–25, Theorem 3, as an additional source input. These form-theoretic operations do not themselves prove universal residual modularity or optimize the classical target.

## Layer R15.4 — The local Serre weight

The local recipe is a function of a continuous two-dimensional representation, with the actual wild extension class preserved. Its arithmetic tables can be expressed on classified data, but obtaining those data and the peu/très predicate comes from local Galois and finite-flat theory. Tame ranges, ordered wild exponents and exceptional classical shifts are part of the definition. The comparisons below specify exactly which local classification and descent results they consume.

### The complete arithmetic recipe

<a id="target-tame-inertia-characters-of-a-local-residual-representation"></a>

#### Tame inertia alternatives

Let ρ_p:G_(ℚ_p)→GL₂(F̄_p) be continuous. Its image is finite. On the semisimplified representation wild inertia is trivial, and the tame inertia characters are either both niveau one or a niveau-two pair ψ^a and (ψ^p)^a exchanged by Frobenius. Use the tame inertia group, its finite-field inverse-limit description, fundamental characters and Frobenius conjugation supplied by ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.2 and the classified local data supplied by R07.5. This step determines the tame character alternatives; it does not erase the wild extension in the original representation.

Prerequisites: FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory `R07.5/tame-inertia-characters`; ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations `R01.2`.

<a id="target-serre-weight-tame-cases"></a>

#### The tame weight table

For the tame niveau-two branch normalize integers 0≤a<b≤p−1 and express the characters using exponent pa+b. Define k=1+pa+b. For the niveau-one branch normalize 0≤a≤b≤p−2 and define the same expression except that the pair (0,0) has classical weight p instead of 1. Thus a supersingular elliptic pair has weight 2, and an unramified representation has classical weight p.

In niveau two the arithmetic twist relation reads k(a,b)=k(0,b−a)+a(p+1) before a change reaches the normalization boundary. A cyclotomic twist of a representation must normalize its characters again and reapply the table; an unrestricted additive weight rule is invalid. The two exponent ranges are different, including at p=2.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.tameExponents`: The normalised exponents (a, b) of Serre 2.2 (level 2, 0 ≤ a < b ≤ p − 1) or 2.3 (level 1, 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ p − 2) of a tamely ramified ρ_p.

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight`: k(ρ_p) = 1 + pa + b in the tame cases, with k = p when ρ_p is unramified.

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_twist`: In the level-2 case, k(χ^a ⊗ ρ′_p) = k(ρ′_p) + a(p + 1) (Serre (2.2.5)).

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_baseChange`: k(ρ_p) depends only on the isomorphism class of ρ_p ⊗ F̄_p.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_supersingular` (computation): For the p-torsion of a supersingular elliptic curve over ℚ_p (characters ψ, ψ′ of level 2, a = 0, b = 1) k = 2.

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_unramified_shift` (degenerate): For ρ_p unramified, (a, b) = (0, 0) and k = p, not the formula's value 1.

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_level_two_p5` (computation): p = 5, level 2 with (a, b) = (1, 3): k = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9 = k′ + a(p + 1) with k′ = 1 + (3 − 1) = 3.

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_normalisation_nonexample` (non-example): Using the level-2 range 0 ≤ a < b ≤ p − 1 in the level-1 case would allow b = p − 1, whose character χ^{p−1} is trivial; the level-1 range stops at p − 2.

<a id="target-peu-et-tres-ramifie-and-the-wild-case-weight"></a>

#### The extension-sensitive wild weight table

When P_p acts nontrivially, the fixed line V^(P_p) is stable under G_(ℚ_p). Preserve its order: α∈[0,p−2] is the quotient exponent and β∈[1,p−1] the stable-line exponent. Normally set

k=1+p min(α,β)+max(α,β).

For β=α+1 the extension class changes the answer. A peu ramifiée extension has k=2+α(p+1). A très ramifiée extension has k=(α+1)(p+1) for odd p and k=4 at p=2. The peu/très distinction uses the actual Kummer extension class, with the required valuation-divisibility condition, from R07.5; it is not a freely selected Boolean attached only to semisimplification.

The ordered stable line, coefficient extension invariance and representation isomorphism invariance enter the API. Extensions with the same semisimplification can have weights 2 and p+1, or 2 and 4 in the dyadic case. The dyadic très case can have the extension parameter value m=3 appearing in Edixhoven §8.5, so a classification restricted to m=1,2 would lose a case.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.wildExponents`: The ordered quotient and stable-line exponents (α,β), with 0≤α≤p−2 and 1≤β≤p−1, where the stable line is D=V^(P_p) for wild inertia P_p.

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_wild`: k = 1 + pa + b with a = min(α, β), b = max(α, β) if β ≠ α + 1; if β = α + 1, k = 2 + α(p + 1) when peu ramifiée and (α + 1)(p + 1) (p odd) or 4 (p = 2) when très ramifiée.

- `TauCeti.SerreWeight.serreWeight_wild_isomorphic`: Isomorphic wild local representations have the same ordered exponents and peu/très branch, hence the same weight.

#### Determinant and parity

For every branch of the complete local recipe, det(ρ_p)|_(I_p)=χ̄_p^(k−1). In tame exponents this is the arithmetic congruence k−1≡a+b mod p−1; the exceptional branches preserve the same determinant congruence. For a global residual representation write det ρ̄=εχ̄_p^(k−1), with the prime-to-p character specified accordingly. If it is odd and p is odd, then ε(−1)=(−1)^k. In characteristic two determinant oddness is automatic for complex conjugation, but this does not require the matrix of complex conjugation to be the identity.

#### Invariance and renormalized twists

Prove that the normalized recipe is invariant under change of basis, unramified twist and coefficient-field extension, with the actual wild extension test transported in each case. Every valid normalized branch gives k≥2. A cyclotomic twist first transports the local representation and then renormalizes its inertia data; crossing a boundary can change the branch, so adding one fixed quantity to all weights is not a valid global rule. Some cyclotomic twist has weight at most p+1. This is a local arithmetic bound and does not produce a modular form or minimize the weight of an existing modularity witness.

### Finite-flat comparisons and exceptional primes

<a id="target-raynaud-prolongation-input-and-the-e-equals-p-minus-one-obstruction"></a>

#### The Raynaud input and its boundary

Use the Raynaud statements supplied by R07.1 for a mixed-characteristic DVR R, residue characteristic p and absolute ramification e. For an F-vector-space generic-fibre scheme of rank q admitting a finite flat model, the maximal model is characterized by v(δ_i)≤p−1 for all i and strict inequality for at least one i. If e<p−1 the model is unique and retains the F-action. At e=p−1, with simple generic fibre and henselian R, either the model is unique or there are exactly two, one étale and one multiplicative; the F-action remains in either case.

Under e<p−1 every commutative p-power-torsion finite generic-fibre group scheme has at most one finite flat model. For commutative finite flat group schemes killed by a power of p, generic-fibre morphisms extend uniquely; their kernels and cokernels are flat and the corresponding Ext map is injective. Over a strictly henselian mixed-characteristic DVR, the tame-character classification expresses a prolongable character as a product of fundamental characters with exponents 0≤n_j≤e; the Jordan–Hölder factors of a prolongable p-power group have this form. At e≥p−1 that numerical bound supplies no restrictive classification.

For the maximal unramified base at p, e=1. Thus odd p lies in the uniqueness range, but p=2 lies exactly on the boundary e=p−1. Tame prolongation over the strict henselian base does not by uniqueness alone descend to ℤ₂. Raynaud's relevant tame prolongation theorem is 3.4.3; the reference to 2.4.3 in Serre's proof has the wrong number. The general statements remain owned by R07.1, and this target records their precise use in the weight criterion.

<a id="target-finite-at-p-equals-peu-ramifie"></a>

#### Finite flatness and peu ramifiée extensions

Let F/F_p be finite and consider the actual upper-triangular representation with diagonal (χ̄_pε₂,ε₁), where ε₁ and ε₂ are unramified. Let D be the integral closure of ℤ_p in the maximal unramified extension. For every p, including 2, the following conditions are equivalent: the extension is peu ramifiée; its generic-fibre F-vector-space scheme has a finite flat F-vector-space model over D; it has one over ℤ_p; its underlying group scheme has a finite flat model over D; it has one over ℤ_p. Use the extension-sensitive theorem of R07.5 for this specific shape.

The Frobenius compatibility of the Kummer classes forces either all valuation parameters α_(i,j) to vanish, giving the peu case, or the quotient character ε₁ε₂⁻¹ to be trivial. In particular très ramifiée forces ε₁=ε₂. For p>2 the explicit peu classification sets λ=(ε₁ε₂⁻¹)(Frob_p), s=[F_p(λ):F_p], n=ord(λ), and f the minimal polynomial of λ. Its unit-class parameter y satisfies f(Frob_p)y=0; the p^s solutions lie in F_(p^n), and their conjugate Kummer classes recover precisely the peu representations. The explicit unit calculation has p>2 as a hypothesis even though the finite-flat equivalence itself is valid at p=2.

<a id="target-weight-two-iff-finite-flat-at-p"></a>

#### The weight-two criterion

The k=2 rows of the local table are the niveau-two pair ψ,ψ′ and the triangular inertia type (χ̄_p,1) with trivial wild action or a peu extension. For ρ_p valued in GL₂(F_p), the finite-flat criterion says

k(ρ_p)=2 ⇔ det(ρ_p)|_(I_p)=χ̄_p and ρ_p is finite at p,

where finite means that its étale generic-fibre group of type (p,p) extends to a finite flat group scheme over ℤ_p. For larger finite coefficient fields the statement requires Raynaud F-vector-space schemes, rather than merely a group of type (p,p). Combine the odd-prime finite-flat criterion supplied by R07.5 with the table; the full dyadic tame branch additionally requires its specified descent input. The determinant condition alone is only the congruence k≡2 mod p−1 and does not select weight two.

<a id="target-edixhoven-weight-k-rho-and-its-comparison-with-serre-k"></a>

#### Edixhoven and classical weights

Define Edixhoven's local weight through his normalized local table and compare it with the classical Serre weight. The tables agree except for the unramified branch, where Edixhoven uses 1 instead of Serre's p, and for the dyadic très branch, where Edixhoven uses 3 instead of Serre's 4. Both differences matter for Katz forms and for theta cycles. The existence and minimality theorem for the Edixhoven weight belongs to SerreWeightAndLevelOptimisation R20.3; it is not a new minimization proof in this layer.

<a id="target-dyadic-weight-two-or-four"></a>

#### The dyadic weight dichotomy

At p=2 the normalized recipe takes only values 2 and 4. Weight 4 occurs exactly in the wild très ramifiée case. If wild inertia acts trivially, the tame characters are trivial or the niveau-two fundamental pair and the weight is 2. In the wild branch finiteness at 2 is equivalent to peu ramifiée by the extension theorem, and an unramified representation is finite through a finite étale model.

For the unipotent representation whose off-diagonal character cuts out ℚ₂(√d), the cases d=5,−1,−5 have weight 2, whereas d=±2,±10 have weight 4. The full equivalence between weight 2 and finite flatness at 2 also needs descent of the tame niveau-two model from ℤ₂^nr to ℤ₂. At e=p−1=1 models can fail to be unique; this descent is a specified R07.5 input, not a consequence of the arithmetic dichotomy alone.

### Applications of the recipe

<a id="target-fontaine-laffaille-weight-comparison"></a>

#### Fontaine–Laffaille weights

Let p≥3 and 1≤r≤p−2. For a rank-two residual Fontaine–Laffaille module over the unramified base ℤ_p with labeled weights {0,r}, use the supplier's contravariant U_S functor and convention HT(χ_cyc)=+1. Its rank-two extension-sensitive classification supplies either reducible inertia with semisimplification χ̄_p^r⊕1 and ordered wild exponents α=0,β=r, or niveau-two characters ψ^r,ψ′^r. In the r=1 extension branch the finite/peu assertion is part of that supplier classification.

Applying the local recipe gives k=r+1. A semisimplification alone would not determine the ordered wild line or the finite/peu case, so those are indispensable hypotheses. The case r=0 instead permits unramified classical weight p; r=p−1 and p=2 lie outside this comparison. This calculation uses the existing functor and local classification, independently of any modular-form existence theorem.

<a id="target-semistable-elliptic-torsion-weight"></a>

#### Semistable elliptic torsion

For semistable elliptic E/ℚ_p, the residual representation E[p] has weight 2 in the good-reduction case, using its finite flat model and the local inertia classification. In the multiplicative case its Tate parameter q_E determines the actual extension class. For odd p its weight is 2 if p∣v_p(j(E)) and p+1 otherwise. At p=2 the same divisible case has weight 2 and the other case has weight 4. Nonsplit multiplicative reduction is the unramified quadratic twist of the Tate case. Import the torsion extension and Kummer class from EllipticCurves Layer 4 and the finite-flat local criterion from R07.5; the numerical weights follow from the full recipe.

Let p≥3 and let an S-type residual representation be normalized by a cyclotomic twist so that 2≤k≤p+1. If its restriction to G_(ℚ(μ_p)) is reducible, then k=(p+1)/2 or (p+3)/2. The local niveau-one case gives p=2k−1 and the niveau-two case gives p=2k−3. ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.4 supplies the induced-dihedral identification through ℚ(√p*), p*=(-1)^((p−1)/2)p, and the projective inertia information. The local calculation uses that image result and the normalized recipe; it cannot be applied to an arbitrary unnormalized weight. The proof input includes Ribet's Proposition 2.2 as cited by the modularity argument, together with the fuller niveau calculation in Dieulefait–Pacetti.

<a id="layer-r15-5"></a>

## Layer R15.5 — Deligne–Serre eigenvalue lifting

The abstract argument lifts the eigencharacter of a residual line in a finite free module. A prime over the generic point and a dominating DVR lift the character; faithful support and a local socle produce an eigenvector realizing it. The lifted eigenvalues have the prescribed residues. A chosen residual vector need not be the reduction of any lifted eigenvector. The modular-form application therefore starts with an actual integral reduction witness and records the full operator family being preserved.

### The eigencharacter and its valuation lift

<a id="target-adjoin-invariant-line"></a>

#### The generated algebra and an invariant line

Let O be a ring, k an O-algebra field and M a k-module. If every operator in an arbitrary family of k-linear operators preserves the line kf, then the O-subalgebra generated by the family also preserves kf. Apply the existing adjoin universal property to the stabilizer subalgebra. This preservation result needs neither a finite family nor pairwise commutativity, and permits f=0. The later construction of a unique scalar-valued character requires f≠0.

Prerequisites: `Algebra.adjoin_le` (Mathlib); `TensorProduct.AlgebraTensorModule.map_tmul` (Mathlib).

<a id="target-eigencharacter-of-invariant-line"></a>

#### The invariant-line eigencharacter

Let H be an O-algebra acting on the k-vector space M by an O-algebra homomorphism r:H→End_k(M), with the compatible scalar tower. If f≠0 and each h∈H sends f into kf, the unique scalar χ(h) in hf=χ(h)f defines an O-algebra homomorphism χ:H→k. The constructor `TauCeti.EigenvalueLifting.eigencharacter` uses the existing AlgHom carrier. Nonzero f gives uniqueness of each scalar and hence compatibility with addition, multiplication and O-scalars. Rescaling by a nonzero scalar leaves χ unchanged. Commutativity of H is unnecessary for this invariant-line construction, though the lifting argument subsequently uses a commutative operator algebra.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.EigenvalueLifting.eigencharacter_apply`: For every h, r(h)f=eigencharacter(r,f)(h) f.

- `TauCeti.EigenvalueLifting.eigencharacter_unique`: Any R-algebra map psi with r(h)f=psi(h)f for every h equals eigencharacter(r,f).

- `TauCeti.EigenvalueLifting.eigencharacter_rescale`: Replacing f by u f for a nonzero u in k, with the induced stability witness, does not change the character.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.EigenvalueLifting.scalar_character_test` (computation): For H=k and a scalar action r(a)x=a x on V=k, the character obtained from f=1 evaluates at a as a.

- `TauCeti.EigenvalueLifting.nilpotent_character_test` (degenerate): Every nilpotent h in H maps to zero under the constructed character, including when r(h) is a nonzero nilpotent operator.

- `TauCeti.EigenvalueLifting.diagonal_character_test` (non-example): For H=k x k acting diagonally on V=k x k, the lines through (1,0) and (0,1) produce different characters: at (1,0) their values are 1 and 0. The constructor must retain the chosen line.

Prerequisites: Mathlib algebra homomorphisms and module actions, with the stated O/k scalar tower and scalar commutation.

<a id="target-horizontal-prime"></a>

#### A horizontal prime

Let H be a finite free commutative O-algebra over a DVR, and χ:H→κ a character over the residue map. Its kernel Q lies above the maximal ideal of O. Flat going down supplies a prime P⊂Q with P∩O=0. Thus H/P is a domain whose generic fibre is a finite field extension of Frac(O). Use the existing flat going-down instance and prime lifting lemma. The prime is selected below the residual kernel so that the later integral character retains that residue.

#### A character valued in a dominating DVR

Choose the horizontal prime, take the fraction field of H/P, pass to the integral closure of O and localize at a prime whose residue realizes the chosen character.

Tau Ceti's integral-closure theorem supplies Dedekindness for any finite fraction-field extension. Separability is not imposed, and the integral closure or V need not be finite as an O-module. Lying over, the nonzero-prime localization and residue-field compatibility enter through the existing commutative-algebra APIs.

### Support, socles and generic eigenvectors

<a id="target-nilpotent-ideal-socle"></a>

#### A socle for a nilpotent ideal

For a commutative ring A, a nonzero A-module V and a nilpotent ideal I, there is a nonzero v∈V with Iv=0. Take the last nonzero term before the action of an ideal power becomes zero, and choose a nonzero vector in it. No finiteness of V is needed. This is the elementary socle input when the maximal ideal of a local Artinian algebra is nilpotent.

#### Descent of a localized socle

Let A be noetherian, I maximal, A_I Artinian, and V an A-module with V_I≠0. The nilpotent-maximal-ideal argument in A_I gives a nonzero localized vector killed by I. Since I has finitely many generators, clear a common denominator for their annihilation equations to obtain a nonzero vector of V killed by I itself. Keep the denominator outside I so the resulting vector remains nonzero after localization. The module V need not be finite; noetherianity supplies finite generation of the ideal used in the descent.

#### Occurrence of every character in a faithful module

Let k be a field, H a finite-dimensional commutative k-algebra and V a finite-dimensional faithful H-module. Every k-algebra character χ:H→k occurs on a nonzero common eigenvector in V. Put I=ker χ. Faithfulness makes the annihilator zero, so the finite-module support theorem gives V_I≠0. The localized algebra is Artinian; its nilpotent radical yields a socle vector, which descends as above. This proves occurrence without a semisimple H-action. Faithfulness is essential, as the two-factor algebra test below demonstrates.

#### Faithfulness of the generic action

Let O be a domain, M a finite free O-module and H⊂End_O(M) the actual operator subalgebra. For a flat O-algebra L the action map L⊗_O H→End_L(L⊗_O M) is injective. Combine the flat tensor inclusion of H into End_O(M) with the finite free endomorphism base-change comparison, checking the action on pure tensors. Apply this with a fraction-field extension to obtain a faithful generic action. Torsion-freeness or finiteness of H alone would not replace that comparison of endomorphisms.

Use a finite basis and the existing fraction-field and module localization APIs. This operation chooses an integral representative of a generic eigenline and does not control its reduction as a prescribed vector.

Prerequisites: Mathlib finite free modules, fraction fields, localization and finite-coordinate denominator clearing.

### The lifting lemma and its sharp limits

<a id="target-deligne-serre-eigenvalue-lifting-lemma"></a>

#### Deligne–Serre eigenvalue lifting

Let O be a DVR with fraction field K and residue κ, let M be finite free over O, and let an arbitrary family (T_i) of pairwise commuting O-linear endomorphisms act on it. Suppose f∈M/ϖM is nonzero and T_if=a_if for scalars a_i∈κ. Then there are a finite extension L/K, a DVR V in L dominating O, a residue-field embedding j:κ→κ_V, scalars b_i∈V and a nonzero common eigenvector f′∈V⊗_O M such that T_if′=b_if′ and b_i reduces to j(a_i) for every i.

Generate the commutative operator algebra H⊂End_O(M). Because O is a DVR and M finite free, H is finite and torsion-free, hence free, even when the chosen family is infinite. The residual line gives χ; a horizontal prime and integral closure lift it to ψ. Flat scalar extension preserves faithfulness. The occurrence theorem produces a generic eigenvector with that character, and coordinate clearing makes it integral. The conclusion preserves the residual eigenvalues. It does not prescribe the reduction of f′, nor assume separability of L/K or module finiteness of V over O.

<a id="target-nilpotent-eigenvector-nonlifting"></a>

#### Failure of prescribed eigenvector lifting

On O² consider T=[[0,ϖ],[0,0]]. Reduction makes T zero, so the residual vector e₂ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue zero. Over any dominating domain the zero-eigenvector equation forces the second coordinate to vanish. Thus no zero-eigenvector reducing to e₂ exists, although the same residual eigenvalue lifts on e₁. This tests the exact eigenvalue conclusion of Deligne–Serre and rules out a prescribed-vector lifting statement.

<a id="target-ramified-eigenvalue-example"></a>

#### Necessity of a fraction-field extension

The operator [[0,ϖ],[1,0]] satisfies T²=ϖ·id. Its residual eigenvalue is zero, but a generic eigenvalue must satisfy λ²=ϖ. Such a root need not lie in K, so a fraction-field extension is necessary. When K has characteristic two the extension can be inseparable; the character-lift formulation must allow that possibility. This example also tests the valuation-ring output rather than requiring an unramified coefficient extension.

<a id="target-nonfaithful-character-nonoccurrence"></a>

#### Failure of occurrence for a nonfaithful action

Let H=k×k act on k through the first projection. The second-projection character cannot occur on a nonzero vector in that module. This finite commutative example has a character and an action but lacks faithfulness, and tests why the occurrence theorem and the generic operator-algebra argument include that hypothesis.

### Application to modular forms

<a id="target-reduction-to-weight-at-least-two-and-to-a-true-eigenform"></a>

#### Controlled eigenform lifting and weight shifts

Fix a finite free integral cusp lattice L over a DVR O at a characteristic-zero coefficient place, with residue characteristic p, weight k, p∤N, integral character ε and a specified commuting family of integral Hecke and diamond operators. Start with a nonzero residual eigenvector actually in L/ϖL. If the input is a Katz form, require its witness in that reduction image. Deligne–Serre lifts this eigenvalue family to characteristic zero after a finite fraction-field extension and a dominating DVR, preserving weight, level and those specified eigenvalues.

A common eigenvector for the full analytic T_n and U_ℓ family has a₁≠0 by the owned coefficient identities, and scales uniquely to a₁=1. A primitive newform conclusion then invokes the old/new theorem of ModularForms Layer 4 and records its level dividing N and the precise character and bad-prime data. A good-prime eigenvector alone does not certify a full normalized eigenform at level N.

For a low-weight reduction form, Deligne–Serre's shift multiplies by a level-one E_n with n≥4 even, (p−1)∣n and E_n≡1 mod p. It reaches weight k+n≥2 with unchanged level and character and congruent good-prime eigenvalues and determinant powers. The Eisenstein integrality is an input. A Katz form outside the integral reduction image instead needs a Hasse-power shift into a range where the exact cusp H¹ and character-projector conditions make reduction surjective. No universal same-weight lift of arbitrary Katz forms is asserted.

## Layer R15.6 — Residual modularity and the classical target

The coefficient field, place, stable lattice and residual semisimplification are explicit parts of a modularity witness. Lattice independence compares witnesses at the same place and attached representation; coefficient conjugation transports the place as well. The local recipe and conductor then define the classical target. Comparisons with geometric mod-p forms use the integral reduction or justified Hasse-shift hypotheses from R15.5.

### Reduction spaces and residual witnesses

<a id="target-residual-modularity-with-a-chosen-place-and-coefficient-field"></a>

#### Classical reduction and Katz forms

Serre's historical mod-p cusp space consists of expansions obtained by reducing the integral analytic lattice of type (N,k,ε₀) at a chosen coefficient place, with p∤N and k≥2. It is the reduction-image subspace S_red from R15.2. Its inclusion into Katz's section space is Hecke-compatible, and equality uses the precise surjectivity and character-lattice hypotheses rather than a dimension count alone.

The classical convention imposes ε(−1)=(−1)^k and requires even k at p=2. That historical convention does not restrict all Katz weights: geometric weight one, including characteristic-two odd weights, is permitted. The k≥2 condition makes T_p reduce to U_p. If level p is introduced in the historical formulation, its removal can raise weight; no level-p integral comparison is supplied merely by the smooth prime-to-p model. The chosen place remains part of the reduction data.

<a id="target-realizability-over-the-field-of-characteristic-polynomials"></a>

#### Descent to characteristic-polynomial coefficients

Use ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.5 for the following descent statement. If φ:G→GL_n(k′) is semisimple, k′ is a finite field, and k⊂k′ contains every coefficient of det(1−φ(g)T) for all g∈G, then φ is realizable over k. Semisimple characteristic-polynomial recognition compares φ with each conjugate, and the trivial Brauer obstruction over a finite field supplies descent. Traces alone are not the hypothesis. In the modular-form application the field generated by eigenvalues and residual character values contains these characteristic-polynomial coefficients through Frobenius recognition. The general representation-theoretic theorem remains the supplier's construction.

Prerequisites: ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations `R01.5`.

<a id="target-residual-modularity-witness"></a>

#### A residual modularity witness

A residual modularity witness for ρ̄ includes a normalized eigenform f with its actual weight and level, its coefficient number field K_f, a place λ∣p, the corresponding coefficient and residue embeddings, an attached λ-adic representation, a chosen stable rank-two integral lattice and an isomorphism from its semisimple reduction to ρ̄ after passage to a common finite residue field. Each attachment and reduction is the actual one supplied by R19 and R01.5, rather than an unrelated matrix representation stored in the same record.

Expose the form, weight, level, coefficient field and place projections. Brauer–Nesbitt gives independence of the stable lattice at the same place and attached characteristic-zero representation. Scalar extension preserves the witness, and coefficient conjugation transports its place and residue embedding. This does not assert that all unrelated coefficient places give the same fixed residual representation. The identity element must act by the identity matrix, so a zero matrix representation cannot be a witness. The suggested carrier record expresses the data whose attachment, place and semisimplification identifications are required here.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.Witness`: A witness contains the eigenform, field, place, stable lattice and residual semisimplification comparison.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.Witness.weight`: The weight of its characteristic-zero normalized eigenform.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.Witness.level`: The level of its normalized eigenform.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.witness_lattice_independent`: Replacing the stable lattice preserves the residual semisimplification.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.witness_zero_representation` (non-example): A rank-two residual witness sends the identity group element to I₂; the zero endomorphism family cannot be its residual representation.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.witness_scalar_extension` (compatibility): A witness extends to a larger finite residue field with the same weight and level.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.witness_place_sensitive` (characterisation): For conjugate coefficient places related by σ, aₗ mod σ(λ) equals σ(aₗ mod λ) under the transported residue embedding; equality with a fixed unrelated residue embedding is not asserted.

Prerequisites: AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations `R19.1`; ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations `R01.5`; AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations `R19.1/lambda-adic-representation-of-a-weight-k-eigenform`; AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations `R19.1/weight-one-artin-representation`.

### Modularity predicates and their comparisons

<a id="target-s-type-arises-from-and-modular"></a>

#### S-type and modularity predicates

For a continuous ρ̄:G_ℚ→GL₂(F̄_p), define S-type to mean absolute irreducibility and odd determinant. In characteristic two the determinant condition for complex conjugation is automatic, while irreducibility remains a separate condition. For a normalized newform f and a chosen embedding ι_p of its coefficient data, define ArisesFrom(ρ̄,f) by a genuine integral model at that place and an isomorphism with the semisimplified reduction of its attached representation. Define IsModular(ρ̄) by the existence of such a form and place-sensitive witness.

Prove coefficient-field invariance using the actual scalar extension, finite-field descent and residue-place transport. The rational elliptic curve 11a1, y²+y=x³−x²−10x−20, supplies a test: its residual representation at 3 is S-type with conductor 11, weight 2 and trivial determinant character, and its associated newform gives a witness. At 5 its rational isogeny supplies a proper invariant line, so it fails S-type. At 2 an involution has determinant −1 in the residue field without requiring the matrix to equal the identity.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.IsSType`: ρ̄ continuous, absolutely irreducible and odd.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.ArisesFrom`: ρ̄ arises from the newform f through ι_p: an integral model of ρ_f reduces to ρ̄.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.IsModular`: ∃ f, ArisesFrom ρ̄ f.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.isSType_baseChange`: IsSType ρ̄ ↔ IsSType (ρ̄ ⊗_F F′).

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.arisesFrom_baseChange`: For absolutely irreducible ρ̄, ArisesFrom ρ̄ f ↔ ArisesFrom (ρ̄ ⊗_F F′) f.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.isSType_11a1_three` (computation): E[3] for 11a1 is of S-type with N = 11, k = 2, ε = 1, and arises from 11a1.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.not_isSType_11a1_five` (non-example): E[5] for 11a1 is reducible, hence not of S-type.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.isSType_p2_odd` (degenerate): At p = 2 oddness is automatic: det ρ̄(c) = 1 = −1 in F.

<a id="target-serre-conjecture-target-with-N-k-epsilon"></a>

#### The classical Serre target

For an S-type ρ̄ define ClassicalTarget(ρ̄) to assert a residual modularity witness with normalized eigenform of weight exactly k(ρ̄), level exactly N(ρ̄) and residual diamond character ε(ρ̄). Here N is the prime-to-p Artin conductor from R01.3, with exponent dim(V/V^(G₀))+b(V), k is the complete local recipe and ε is determined by det ρ̄=εχ̄_p^(k−1). This defines the target, proves its implication to modularity and its field-transport equivalences, and states the conditional geometric formulation. Universal truth and optimization are supplied by the respective neighbouring roadmaps.

Serre's bad-prime eigenvalue prediction is a further refinement: a_ℓ≠0 precisely when the local representation admits the relevant one-dimensional unramified quotient, and then a_ℓ is its Frobenius eigenvalue. The p-unramified classical weight-p situation allows two p-eigenvalues with product ε(p). These data distinguish the exact target from a bare good-prime eigensystem. The unramified local branch uses classical weight p, and the dyadic très branch uses 4; replacing them by Edixhoven's 1 and 3 would change this predicate.

The interface consists of:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.ClassicalTarget`: Existence of a witness of the invariant level, weight and residual character.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.classicalTarget_implies_modular`: A classical-target witness is a modularity witness.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.classicalTarget_baseChange`: The target is invariant under extending the finite residual field.

Examples and boundary cases:

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.target_weight_two` (characterisation): The requested weight is 2 precisely under the explicit local finite-flat and determinant criterion.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.target_unramified` (non-example): At odd p and unramified local representation the requested classical weight is p, rather than Edixhoven’s weight 1.

- `TauCeti.ResidualModularity.target_dyadic` (computation): At p=2 a wild très-ramifiée local representation requests weight4, not3.

#### Geometric and classical modularity formulations

For an absolutely irreducible odd residual representation, compare the existence of a normalized geometric mod-p eigensystem giving it with a characteristic-zero residual witness at a controlled shifted weight and level. The forward direction uses R15.5 only after its actual reduction-image hypothesis or justified Hasse shift; R19 attaches the lifted representation, and R01.5 recognizes its semisimple reduction from Frobenius characteristic polynomials away from pN. The reverse direction uses the integral lattice comparison and reduction. The cusp H¹ and integral character-projector conditions are part of this equivalence.

The determinant is det ρ̄=ε̄χ̄_p^(k−1), hence ε̄(−1)=(−1)^k for odd p. A shift n divisible by p−1 preserves its cyclotomic exponent. The weight-two consequence is exactly the finite-flat determinant criterion in its specified coefficient setting, with the dyadic tame descent interface retained. The equivalence compares witnesses and representations; it does not establish minimal weight or conductor level.

## Supplier interfaces and proof requirements

The targets above have concrete mathematical prerequisites. A complete implementation must receive the following interfaces with their hypotheses. Naming a carrier or calculating on a formal series is insufficient to replace them.

| Supplier | Required interface and consuming layers |
| --- | --- |
| ModularCurvesPartII R12.5, R13.3 | Hodge line on the compactified stack; full reduced Cartier cusp divisor; Tate(t^n) charts, level structures and vanishing-order comparison; finite cusp types and compatibility with diamonds. Used by R15.1–R15.3. |
| ModularCurvesPartII R13.4a, R13.4b | Proper rigidifying covers, effective section descent and coherent finiteness/base change; auxiliary quotient/contraction and differential extension across cusps, compatible with Δ. Used for small levels, lattices and w_x. |
| ModularCurvesPartII R13.5 | Ordinary Igusa tower with tautological differential and full unit monodromy modulo p^m, including p=2,3; finite supersingular locus with simple elliptic Hasse zeros and isogeny stability. Used by theta, ordinary congruences and supersingular weight reduction. |
| ModularCurvesPartII R14.1 | Compactified degeneracy and Hecke correspondences, quotient level structures, universal isogeny Hodge maps, U_y and the root-dependent curve map. The auxiliary w_x and its square are constructed here. |
| AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A4; AutomorphicBundles B3 | Elliptic de Rham bundle, filtration, connection, cup product, base change and isogeny functoriality, with their logarithmic extensions. Used to prove KS. |
| ComplexComparisonPartII C2 | Projective coherent GAGA for integer Hodge powers and cusp twists, compatible with the finite action and descent. Used by analytic comparison. |
| SchemeAndStackFoundations SF.2, SF.3 and coherent duality | Proper adjunction and trace; relative Serre duality over a DVR with K/O coefficients, finite-free/base-change hypotheses and finite-flat correspondence functoriality. Used by coherent Hecke and twisted duality. |
| FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory R07.1, R07.2 | Raynaud uniqueness, its boundary case and tame inertia; the general BT₁ determinant(V*) and dual-Frobenius compatibility. Used by the local criterion and elliptic Hasse specialization. |
| FiniteFlatGroupsAndIntegralPadicHodgeTheory R07.3, R07.5 | Contravariant residual Fontaine–Laffaille functor and positive-weight inertia dictionary; rank-two extension classification, ordered wild line, Kummer peu/très and finite-flat comparisons; dyadic tame model descent. Used by R15.4. |
| ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.2–R01.5 | Fundamental tame characters and Frobenius action; genuine prime-to-p Artin conductor; S-type induced-dihedral image identification; finite-field semisimplification, coefficient descent, lattice independence and recognition by characteristic polynomials. Used by R15.4 and R15.6 and boundary localization. |
| AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.1 | Weight≥2 λ-adic attachment, weight-one Artin attachment, residual attachment for reduction eigenforms, coefficient-place transport and stable-lattice comparison. These precede the final modularity predicates. |
| ModularForms Layers 0, 4, 8, 8W, 10C | Existing analytic carriers, character and Eisenstein normalization, full Hecke eigenform normalization and primitive associates, integral algebra and all-cusp lattice including weight one, and analytic automorphy and cusp conventions. |
| EllipticCurves Layers 3–4 | Relative Frobenius and Verschiebung and their differential actions; semistable reduction, Tate torsion extension and the actual Kummer parameter including unramified twists. |

Several proof obligations need more than the named geometric carrier. Q-expansion vanishing uses filtered-colimit cohomology, faithfully flat noetherian completion, formal functions, Krull intersection and the Artin-base depth argument. Fine-level base change uses proper coherent finiteness, curve degree and duality vanishing, with the n≤11 weight-one cusp calculation. The strong principle also uses a reduction from coefficient modules to the Artin-local argument and positive-weight constant-expansion vanishing in characteristic zero. These are foundational proof inputs for the stated q-expansion results.

Integral cusp comparison needs the exact H¹-torsion and integral character-projector criterion. Its Hasse shift must land in that specific image, with character and level retained. The all-prime denominator application needs the analytic theorem at primes dividing the level and its geometric model comparison. Eisenstein congruences and Deligne–Serre shifts need the Bernoulli valuation and coefficient-integrality input, including the even shifts at p=2,3. None of these follows from holomorphic fine-level base change alone.

Weight-one T_p over O/ϖ^m needs Gross's coefficient-general section-preservation construction in addition to U+⟨p⟩V. Theta cycles need their filtration drop and cycle proof input, and the exceptional level-one p=2,3 reduction needs Serre's Astérisque theorem. Supersingular weight reduction needs simple Hasse zeros and support preservation under field duality over the finite operator-image algebra. The local comparisons need the extension-sensitive Fontaine–Laffaille classification, dyadic tame descent and the induced-dihedral image input cited to Ribet. These obligations retain the precise supplier boundaries of their targets.

## Reading and suggested Lean statements

The [suggested file](Suggested.lean) records the algebraic statements, API names and example fragments using the available library carriers. Its complete abstract eigenvalue-lifting signatures are separate from geometric templates whose missing identifications and conditions are written beside them. The complete mathematical statements are the ones in this README. A geometric template with omitted supplier conditions is not a theorem for arbitrary presheaves, maps, power series or representations. Likewise, the data-only residual witness record requires the actual attachment, place and semisimplification comparisons before it certifies modularity.

The examples distinguish both positive results and failure modes: negative global weights versus negative supersingular fibres, weight-zero functions versus constants, integral reductions versus all Katz forms, linear V versus absolute Frobenius, curve Fricke versus its Hodge scalar, full-boundary characters versus a single cusp orbit, peu versus très with the same semisimplification, and eigenvalue lifting versus a prescribed residual vector. These distinctions constrain the formal interfaces as much as the headline statements do.
