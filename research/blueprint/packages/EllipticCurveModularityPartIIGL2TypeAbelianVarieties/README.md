# Modularity and modular parametrisations of elliptic curves over ℚ, Part II: abelian varieties of GL₂-type

An abelian variety over ℚ can have dimension greater than one while its endomorphisms split its Tate module into two-dimensional pieces. This roadmap proves modularity for these varieties: every abelian variety of GL₂-type over ℚ is a quotient of a modular Jacobian J₁(N). For a ℚ-simple variety A of dimension n, the attached weight-two newform has coefficient field End⁰_ℚ(A), its conductor is Nⁿ, and its least modular level is N. The resulting pointed map from X₁(N) to A has image generating A. A totally real endomorphism field gives the Γ₀ version.

The second goal concerns ℚ-curves: elliptic curves over ℚ̄ isogenous to all their Galois conjugates. Ribet's cocycle and restriction-of-scalars construction put every non-CM ℚ-curve inside a primitive GL₂-type variety over ℚ. Modularity over ℚ then supplies a modular Jacobian quotient over ℚ̄. Over a solvable Galois field of definition, a finite character twist and solvable base change give an automorphic representation with the elliptic curve's local factors at every finite place. In particular, ℚ-curves over real or imaginary quadratic fields are modular in the sense used by Caraiani–Newton.

The proof of modularity follows residual representations through Serre's theorem, a bounded collection of weight-two newforms, exact identification of coefficients, comparison of rational Tate modules, and Faltings' isogeny criterion. All-place Weil–Deligne compatibility is deduced after modularity; it is not a hypothesis of this proof. This order keeps the good-prime argument independent of the stronger local compatibility convention.

## Scope and neighbouring roadmaps

EllipticCurveModularity R29 proves the dimension-one theorem. GT.3–GT.4 generalise its constructions and compare the pointed parametrisations when the same quotient and Abel–Jacobi map are chosen. This roadmap owns the structural results specific to GL₂-type varieties, their modularity and exact level, and the forward ℚ-curve construction. The GL₂(E)-type bundle itself belongs to SmallRamificationAndAbelianVarietyBaseCases R25.5, and its Tate modules belong to ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.6.

AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A1–A3 and A6 supply geometry, rational endomorphisms, polarizations, images, isogenies and Weil restriction. ModularCurvesPartII R14.2, R14.5 and R14.6 supply the curves, Jacobians, Hecke quotients A_f and rational pointed Abel–Jacobi maps. AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19 supplies newform representations and local compatibility; ClassicalSerreModularity R27.6 supplies the strong Serre theorem. Faltings' comparison theorems, p-adic Hodge theory, Néron models, automorphic base change and reciprocity are imported at the layers specified below.

The theory of inner twists and geometric building blocks beyond the squared-trace field is outside the scope. Ribet's converse from geometric factors to ℚ-curves is also outside the scope. General modularity over a nonsolvable field is not asserted. CM ℚ-curves enter the final quadratic-field conclusion through Caraiani–Newton's separate CM alternative, rather than through the rational-valued non-CM cocycle construction.

## Conventions

An abelian variety is the native [`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety K`](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/blob/f790474821cf4256814db967cb154e7af3d0c369/TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AbelianVariety/Basic.lean). Its integral endomorphism ring is [`AbelianVariety.End A`](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/blob/f790474821cf4256814db967cb154e7af3d0c369/TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AbelianVariety/End/Basic.lean), whose addition is the pointwise group law and whose multiplication is composition. Set End⁰_K(A) = ℚ ⊗_ℤ End_K(A). Rational inverse and conjugation statements use this algebra and rationalized Hom groups. They preserve the existing ring operations. An E-equivariant isogeny intertwines the two actual E-actions; in native integral morphisms this can be expressed after clearing a common integer denominator.

A GL₂(E)-type structure is an injection E ↪ End⁰_ℚ(A) from a number field with [E : ℚ] = dim A. Unless a target explicitly treats powers or general modular quotients, A is ℚ-simple: it has positive dimension and has no nonzero proper abelian subvariety over ℚ. This condition is stronger than E-stability. Native `A.dim` takes values in `WithBot ℕ∞`; the finite dimension is the rank of its tangent space. The library theorem [`AbelianVariety.finrank_tangentSpace_eq_dim`](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/blob/a91d3aafa8cd3e6bc33dfde0d7677ed0f1625039/TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/AbelianVariety/TangentSpace.lean#L193) identifies these dimensions, so no independent dimension parameter is used.

Fix an algebraic closure ℚ̄ and write G_K for the absolute Galois group with its Krull topology. Tate modules are covariant. Frob_p is arithmetic Frobenius, and the cyclotomic character χ_ℓ has Hodge–Tate weight 1. For a ℚ-simple A let E = End⁰_ℚ(A), S be its finite set of bad primes, λ a prime of E over ℓ, and E_λ its completion. The native decomposition is

V_ℓ(A) = ⊕_{λ | ℓ} V_λ(A),   dim_{E_λ} V_λ(A) = 2.

The representation ρ_λ is the action on that component. The symbols a_p, d_p and ε acquire their meaning in GT.2. A residual representation means the action on the actual λ-torsion of an integral model, and its semisimplification is compared with reduction of the rational representation. Residue fields are embedded into one algebraic closure before two residual representations are compared. Residue degree one does not imply E_λ = ℚ_ℓ unless ramification is also excluded.

All modular levels are positive. Modularity of level N means a surjective ℚ-homomorphism J₁(N) → A; Γ₀ modularity uses J₀(N). A level in this definition need not be the least level. The exact-level theorem assumes ℚ-simplicity: for powers, the availability of enough oldform copies is an additional requirement.

For a normalized weight-two newform f use the existing [`HeckeRing.GL2.Newform`](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti/blob/f790474821cf4256814db967cb154e7af3d0c369/TauCeti/NumberTheory/ModularForms/Newforms/Newform.lean) carrier. Its coefficient field is K_f, its character is ε_f, and A_f is the Hecke quotient of the modular Jacobian. Coefficient fields and quotient actions are supplied by their owners, rather than encoded as arbitrary fields or representations. The fixed-level multiplicity-one theorem is used only with its actual fixed-level and nebentypus hypotheses; agreement at almost all primes across different levels uses ModularForms Layer 5.

In GT.5 the coefficient groups ℚˣ and ℚ̄ˣ are discrete and have trivial G_ℚ-action. Their multiplicative law is presented additively for continuous cohomology. Tate's vanishing is not a statement about the natural Galois action on ℚ̄ˣ. A family μ_g consists of geometric conjugate isogenies defined over a common finite Galois field. That field is enlarged again when needed so that the locally constant splitting map α factors through its Galois group.

Serre's good-prime compatibility in GT.2 fixes E-rational Frobenius polynomials outside S. Khare–Wintenberger strict compatibility in GT.4 fixes local Weil–Deligne parameters at every place, including the coefficient prime. The latter may require a finite extension E′/E to realize all the parameters. Analytic normalization is L(Π,s−1/2) = L(A,s) in weight two. The normalized Fricke functional equation retains i² = −1 until its constants are absorbed into the root number.

## GT.1 — Abelian varieties of GL₂-type and their endomorphism algebras

The GL₂-type bundle is imported from R25.5. This layer identifies its rational endomorphism algebra, separates powers from primitive varieties, and establishes the structural properties used by the modularity argument. Every action is an action on an actual abelian variety.

**Lemma.** If a finite-dimensional division ℚ-algebra D acts unitally on End⁰_ℚ(A), then dim_ℚ D divides dim A. Consequently an E-stable, nonzero abelian subvariety B of a GL₂(E)-type A equals A. Stability here is up to isogeny: integer multiples of every element of E act on B.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: the map D → End⁰_ℚ(A) sends 1 to the identity; B is stable under E up to isogeny: every e ∈ E has a multiple n·e ∈ End_ℚ(A) mapping B into B.

Construction and proof route:

1. End⁰_ℚ(A) acts ℚ-linearly on the tangent space Lie(A/ℚ) = T₀A (Tau Ceti AbelianVariety.TangentSpace), of ℚ-dimension dim A; an isogeny induces an isomorphism on tangent spaces in characteristic 0, so endomorphisms up to isogeny act.
2. A unital module over a division algebra is free, so dim_ℚ D divides dim_ℚ Lie(A/ℚ) = dim A.
3. For B: E acts on Lie(B/ℚ), of dimension dim B, so [E : ℚ] = dim A divides dim B ≤ dim A, whence B = A.

Checks on the statement:

- For E × E with E an elliptic curve over ℚ, every quadratic field acting has degree 2 = dim; no cubic field acts.
- Over 𝔽_p the tangent-space argument fails: the Frobenius endomorphism acts by zero on Lie.

### GT.1/primitive — Primitive abelian varieties of GL₂-type and the power construction

**Definition.** Given a GL₂(F)-type B over ℚ and a finite extension E/F of degree n, choose an F-basis of E. Define E ⊗_F B as the power Bⁿ, equipped with the E-action through its regular representation E ↪ M_n(F) ↪ End⁰_ℚ(Bⁿ). Its dimension is [E : ℚ], so it is of GL₂(E)-type. A GL₂(E)-type A is primitive when no E-equivariant ℚ-isogeny identifies it with such a construction for [E : F] > 1. The equivariant isogeny class is independent of the chosen basis.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: the isogeny class of E ⊗_F B with its E-action does not depend on the chosen F-basis of E.

Required API:

- `GL2Type.power` (constructor): E ⊗_F B for B of GL₂(F)-type over ℚ and a finite extension E/F with a chosen F-basis.
- `GL2Type.power_dim` (simp): dim (E ⊗_F B) = [E : F] · dim B.
- `GL2Type.power_basis_indep` (characterisation): The power constructions for two F-bases of E are E-equivariantly ℚ-isogenous (the change of basis has entries in F, acting through End⁰).
- `GL2Type.IsPrimitive` (data): The predicate on (A, E): not E-equivariantly ℚ-isogenous to a power construction with [E : F] > 1.
- `GL2Type.IsPrimitive.of_isogeny` (functoriality): Primitivity is invariant under E-equivariant ℚ-isogeny.
- `GL2Type.isPrimitive_iff_isSimple` (equivalence): A is primitive if and only if A is ℚ-simple (GT.1/ribet-theorem-2-1).

Definition tests:

- `GL2Type.power_degree_one` (degenerate): For E = F the power construction is B itself with its structure, and B is primitive exactly when it is ℚ-simple.
- `GL2Type.power_not_primitive` (non-example): For an elliptic curve B over ℚ and E = ℚ(√2), E ⊗_ℚ B = B × B is of GL₂(E)-type but not primitive.
- `GL2Type.J0_23_primitive` (computation): J₀(23), of dimension two with E = ℚ(√5) acting through the Hecke algebra, is primitive.
- `GL2Type.power_compat_R25_5` (compatibility): The power construction satisfies the definition of SmallRamificationAndAbelianVarietyBaseCases R25.5: [E : ℚ] = dim (E ⊗_F B).

Construction and proof route:

1. Embed E into M_n(F) by its action on the chosen basis and let M_n(F) act on Bⁿ by matrices with entries in the image of F (A6: End⁰(Bⁿ) = M_n(End⁰(B))).
2. Then [E : ℚ] = n[F : ℚ] = n dim B = dim Bⁿ, so the construction is of GL₂(E)-type; a change of basis conjugates the embedding by an element of GL_n(F) ⊆ GL_n(End⁰_ℚ(B)), which is an E-equivariant isogeny of Bⁿ.

Checks on the statement:

- For n > 1, E ⊗_F B = Bⁿ is not ℚ-simple.
- Every elliptic curve over ℚ is primitive (E = ℚ).

### GT.1/ribet-theorem-2-1 — Ribet's Theorem 2.1: primitive, simple and maximal endomorphism field

**Theorem.** For GL₂(E)-type A, put X = End⁰_ℚ(A). The centralizer of E in X is E. Its centre F lies in E; with n = [E : F], one has X ≃ M_n(F) and an E-equivariant ℚ-isogeny A ∼ E ⊗_F B, where B is ℚ-simple, End⁰_ℚ(B) = F and B has GL₂(F)-type. Thus primitivity, ℚ-simplicity, and the assertion that X is a number field of degree dim A are equivalent. Under these equivalent conditions the given copy of E is all of X.

Construction and proof route:

1. The commutant D of E in X is a division algebra: a nonzero endomorphism commuting with E has image B ⊆ A on which E acts, so B = A by GT.1/lie-algebra-divisibility, and the endomorphism is an isogeny (A6).
2. Lie(A/ℚ) is a D-module, so dim_ℚ D divides dim A = [E : ℚ] (GT.1/lie-algebra-divisibility); as E ⊆ D, D = E. Hence E is a maximal commutative subalgebra of the semisimple algebra X (A6) and the centre F of X lies in E.
3. X is simple (its centre F is a field), so X ≅ M_n(Q) with Q a division algebra of dimension t² over F, and maximality of E gives nt = [E : F]. A is isogenous to Bⁿ with End⁰(B) = Q (A6, Poincaré reducibility), and the Lie argument gives n t² [F : ℚ] | [E : ℚ] = nt[F : ℚ], so t = 1, Q = F and n = [E : F].
4. Each of (i)–(iii) is equivalent to n = 1.

Checks on the statement:

- For A = B × B with B an elliptic curve over ℚ without CM and E = ℚ(i): X = M₂(ℚ), F = ℚ, n = 2.
- For J₀(23): X = ℚ(√5), n = 1.

### GT.1/endomorphism-field — The endomorphism field of a ℚ-simple GL₂-type variety

**Construction.** For a ℚ-simple GL₂-type A define E_A to be its actual rational endomorphism algebra, with the compatible number-field structure supplied by the preceding theorem. Its degree is dim A and its identity action supplies GL₂(E_A)-type. Any given GL₂(E)-type embedding ι is an isomorphism E ≃ E_A. Transport along ι identifies the coefficient fields, primes and λ-adic representations of the two descriptions.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: A is ℚ-simple and of GL₂(E)-type for some E (SmallRamificationAndAbelianVarietyBaseCases R25.5).

Required API:

- `GL2Type.endField` (data): E_A = End⁰_ℚ(A) as a field, for ℚ-simple A of GL₂-type.
- `GL2Type.endField_numberField` (instance): E_A is a number field.
- `GL2Type.endField_finrank` (projection): [E_A : ℚ] = dim A.
- `GL2Type.endField_isGL2Type` (constructor): The tautological GL₂(E_A)-type structure in the sense of R25.5.
- `GL2Type.endField_equiv` (characterisation): Every GL₂(E)-type structure ι on A is a field isomorphism E ≃ E_A.
- `GL2Type.endField_isogeny` (functoriality): A ℚ-isogeny φ : A → A′ induces E_A ≃ E_{A′}, α ↦ φ ∘ α ∘ φ⁻¹, compatibly with the λ-adic representations.
- `GL2Type.endField_involution` (other): The canonical involution of E_A (GT.1/totally-real-or-cm) is the Rosati involution of every ℚ-polarization.

Definition tests:

- `GL2Type.endField_elliptic` (degenerate): For an elliptic curve E₀ over ℚ, E_{E₀} = ℚ (End_ℚ(E₀) = ℤ, EllipticCurveModularity R29.1).
- `GL2Type.endField_J0_23` (computation): E_{J₀(23)} = ℚ(√5), generated by the Hecke operator T₂ with T₂² + T₂ − 1 = 0.
- `GL2Type.endField_J1_13` (computation): E_{J₁(13)} = ℚ(√−3), a CM field, matching the order-6 character of the newform of level 13.
- `GL2Type.endField_not_simple` (non-example): For B × B with B an elliptic curve over ℚ, End⁰_ℚ = M₂(ℚ) is not a field: simplicity is needed.

Construction and proof route:

1. By GT.1/ribet-theorem-2-1, X = End⁰_ℚ(A) is a number field of degree dim A containing ι(E), hence equal to ι(E).
2. Transport of structure along ι identifies the λ-adic representations V_λ(A) for E and for E_A.

Checks on the statement:

- For an elliptic curve over ℚ, E_A = ℚ.
- For J₀(23), E_A = ℚ(√5); for J₁(13), E_A = ℚ(√−3).

### GT.1/totally-real-or-cm — The endomorphism field is totally real or CM, with the Rosati involution as canonical involution

**Theorem.** The endomorphism field of a ℚ-simple GL₂-type A is totally real or CM. Every polarization defined over ℚ induces the same restriction of Rosati to that field: the identity in the totally real case and the canonical complex conjugation in the CM case. In particular this field involution is independent of the polarization.

Construction and proof route:

1. A ℚ-polarization λ defines the Rosati involution † on End⁰_ℚ(A) = E (A2), a positive involution: Tr(x x†) > 0 for x ≠ 0 (A6/rosati-positivity).
2. A number field with a positive involution is totally real with trivial involution, or CM with the involution equal to complex conjugation under every complex embedding: this is the commutative case of the Albert classification (PELModuli M0 with B = E: types C and A of degree one).
3. The complex conjugation of a CM field is unique, so † is independent of λ.

Checks on the statement:

- For J₀(23), E = ℚ(√5) is totally real and every Rosati involution is the identity on E.
- For J₁(13), E = ℚ(√−3) and the Rosati involution is complex conjugation.

### GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type — The modular quotient A_f is ℚ-simple of GL₂-type with endomorphism field K_f

**Theorem.** Let f be a normalized weight-two newform on Γ₁(N), with positive N, coefficient field K_f and character ε_f. The quotient A_f = J₁(N)/p_f J₁(N) of R14.5 is ℚ-simple, and its Hecke action identifies K_f with End⁰_ℚ(A_f); in particular it has GL₂(K_f)-type. More generally J₁(N) is ℚ-isogenous to ∏_{M | N} ∏_{[g]} A_g^{d(N/M)}, where [g] runs through the coefficient-conjugacy orbits of weight-two newforms of level M and d is the divisor-counting function.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: f is a newform: an eigenform for all T_n and diamond operators, new at level N, with a₁(f) = 1.

Construction and proof route:

1. dim A_f = [K_f : ℚ] and the K_f-action are ModularCurvesPartII R14.5; so A_f is of GL₂(K_f)-type.
2. V_ℓ(A_f) ≅ ⊕_{λ|ℓ} ρ_{f,λ} (AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.6), with the ρ_{f,λ} ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ for the different embeddings σ : K_f → ℚ̄_ℓ absolutely irreducible (R19.1) and pairwise non-isomorphic: their traces σ(a_p(f)) at Frob_p differ for distinct σ because K_f is generated by the a_p(f), p ∤ N (ModularCurvesPartII R14.5). Faltings (R28.4/semisimplicity-and-the-tate-homomorphism-comparison) gives End⁰_ℚ(A_f) ⊗ ℚ_ℓ = End_{G_ℚ} V_ℓ(A_f) = K_f ⊗ ℚ_ℓ, so End⁰_ℚ(A_f) = K_f (Ribet 1980, Cor. 4.2, by a different argument).
3. A field endomorphism algebra forces ℚ-simplicity (GT.1/ribet-theorem-2-1). The isogeny decomposition of J₁(N) follows from the old/new decomposition of S₂(Γ₁(N)) (Tau Ceti ModularForms layer 3) and the Hecke-equivariant identification of the cotangent space of J₁(N) with S₂(Γ₁(N)).

Checks on the statement:

- N = 11: A_f = J₀(11) = X₀(11), K_f = ℚ.
- N = 23: A_f = J₀(23), K_f = ℚ(√5).
- N = 13 on Γ₁: J₁(13) is A_f for the newform with character of order 6; K_f = ℚ(√−3) is CM.

## GT.2 — The λ-adic system of a GL₂-type abelian variety

Throughout this layer A is ℚ-simple of GL₂-type, E = End⁰_ℚ(A), S is its set of bad primes, and ρ_λ acts on the native V_λ(A). This common hypothesis applies to every target below. The integral model is used whenever residual torsion is mentioned. The layer proves precisely the hypotheses needed to apply the weight-two Serre theorem.

### GT.2/integral-model — The integral model with endomorphism ring 𝒪_E

**Construction.** Choose an E-equivariant ℚ-isogeny A → A′ such that End_ℚ(A′) identifies with 𝒪_E. Such an A′ exists. For every maximal ideal λ of 𝒪_E the actual group A′[λ] is a two-dimensional vector space over 𝔽_λ with continuous G_ℚ-action. Its semisimplification is the semisimplified reduction of ρ_λ and is independent of the integral model.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: the residual representation of R01.6 (d) requires 𝒪_E ⊆ End_ℚ(A′); this node supplies such an A′.

Required API:

- `GL2Type.integralModel` (constructor): An E-equivariantly isogenous A′ with End_ℚ(A′) = 𝒪_E.
- `GL2Type.integralModel_end` (projection): End_ℚ(integralModel A) = 𝒪_E as subrings of E.
- `GL2Type.residualRep` (data): ρ̄_λ : G_ℚ → GL(A′[λ]) ≅ GL₂(𝔽_λ), from R01.6 lambdaTorsion.
- `GL2Type.residualRep_finrank` (simp): dim_{𝔽_λ} A′[λ] = 2.
- `GL2Type.residualRep_charpoly` (characterisation): For p ∉ S, p ∉ λ: the characteristic polynomial of ρ̄_λ(Frob_p) is X² − ā_p X + ε̄(p)p, the reduction of GT.2/frobenius-polynomial.
- `GL2Type.residualRep_ss_indep` (other): ρ̄_λ^{ss} is independent of the integral model and of the lattice.

Definition tests:

- `GL2Type.residualRep_elliptic` (compatibility): For an elliptic curve E₀ over ℚ, ρ̄_ℓ is the action on E₀[ℓ] of ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.6.
- `GL2Type.residualRep_det` (computation): det ρ̄_λ = ε̄ · χ̄_ℓ, the reduction of GT.2/determinant-character.
- `GL2Type.integralModel_trivial` (degenerate): If End_ℚ(A) = 𝒪_E already (for example A_f with 𝒪_{K_f} acting), A′ = A is an integral model.
- `GL2Type.residualRep_not_A_l` (non-example): A′[ℓ] is not A′[λ] unless λ = ℓ𝒪_E: A′[ℓ] = ⊕_{λ|ℓ} A′[λ^{e_λ}] has 𝔽_ℓ-dimension 2[E : ℚ].

Construction and proof route:

1. For each ℓ put L_ℓ = 𝒪_E·T_ℓ(A) ⊆ V_ℓ(A): a G_ℚ-stable, 𝒪_E-stable lattice containing T_ℓ(A), equal to it for ℓ ∤ [𝒪_E : End_ℚ(A) ∩ E]. Then K = ⊕_ℓ L_ℓ/T_ℓ(A) is a finite Galois-stable subgroup of A(ℚ̄), A′ = A/K (A3, quotients by finite subgroup schemes) has T_ℓ(A′) = L_ℓ, and every element of 𝒪_E preserves every T_ℓ(A′), hence lies in End_ℚ(A′) (A6/hom-to-tate-module-homs-is-injective, saturation of End in End ⊗ ℤ_ℓ); so End_ℚ(A′) = 𝒪_E.
2. T_ℓ(A′) is free of rank two over 𝒪_E ⊗ ℤ_ℓ (A6/trace-and-degree-on-a-subfield with R01.6 (d)), so A′[λ] = T_λ(A′)/λT_λ(A′) is two-dimensional over 𝔽_λ, and Brauer–Nesbitt gives the independence of the semisimplification from the lattice, hence from A′.

Checks on the statement:

- For an elliptic curve over ℚ, A′ = A and A′[ℓ] = A[ℓ].
- Two integral models are related by an 𝒪_E-equivariant isogeny; the semisimplified residual representations agree.

### GT.2/frobenius-polynomial — E-rationality of the Frobenius polynomials

**Theorem.** For each good prime p there are a_p,d_p ∈ 𝒪_E such that, for every λ not over p, ρ_λ is unramified at p and has arithmetic Frobenius polynomial X² − a_p X + d_p. The coefficients are read through E ↪ E_λ and are independent of λ. This is E-rational strict compatibility in the good-prime sense of Serre, with exceptional set S.

Construction and proof route:

1. Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich: ρ_λ is unramified at p ∉ S, p ≠ ℓ, and ρ_λ(Frob_p) is induced by the Frobenius endomorphism π_p of the reduction A_p, which commutes with E acting by reduction (R01.6 (f), R01.6/good-reduction-frobenius-polynomial).
2. For α in the commutant of E in End⁰(A_p), the E ⊗ ℚ_ℓ-linear trace t_ℓ(α) of α on the free module V_ℓ(A_p) (A6/trace-and-degree-on-a-subfield) satisfies Tr_{E⊗ℚ_ℓ/ℚ_ℓ}(e·t_ℓ(α)) = Tr(eα | V_ℓ) for all e ∈ E; the right side is the rational trace of eα ∈ End⁰(A_p), independent of ℓ (A6/characteristic-polynomial-on-tate-module). Nondegeneracy of the trace form of E (traceForm_nondegenerate) gives t_ℓ(α) ∈ E, independent of ℓ.
3. Take a_p = t(π_p) and d_p = (t(π_p)² − t(π_p²))/2; integrality because π_p is integral over ℤ.

Checks on the statement:

- For E = ℚ: a_p = p + 1 − #A_p(𝔽_p) and d_p = p.
- For J₀(23), p = 2: X² − a₂X + 2 with a₂ = (−1 + √5)/2.

### GT.2/determinant-character — Ribet's Lemma 3.1: the determinant is ε·χ_ℓ

**Theorem.** One finite-order E-valued character ε works for all λ: det ρ_λ = εχ_ℓ for λ | ℓ. It is unramified at all good primes, has N_{E/ℚ}(ε) = 1, and may be viewed as a Dirichlet character supported only at bad primes. Consequently d_p = ε(p)p at every good p.

Construction and proof route:

1. Choose ℓ₀ ∉ S split completely in E (Chebotarev) and λ₀ | ℓ₀, so δ = det ρ_{λ₀} : G_ℚ → ℤ_{ℓ₀}^×. By FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems R28.2, δ = ⟨χ⟩^a·ε₀ with ε₀ of finite order.
2. δ is Hodge–Tate of weight 1 at ℓ₀ (GT.2/crystalline-at-good-primes), so a = 1; ε = δχ_{ℓ₀}⁻¹ is crystalline of weight 0 at ℓ₀, hence unramified there (PadicHodgeTheory R06.2), and unramified at p ∉ S ∪ {ℓ₀} by Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich.
3. ε(Frob_p) = d_p/p ∈ E for p ∉ S ∪ {ℓ₀}, so ε is E-valued; for every λ, det ρ_λ and εχ_ℓ agree on Frob_p for almost all p, hence are equal (Chebotarev). Comparing det_{ℚ_ℓ} V_ℓ(A) = χ_ℓ^{dim A} (R01.6/determinant-and-oddness) with ∏_λ N_{E_λ/ℚ_ℓ}(εχ_ℓ) gives N_{E/ℚ}(ε) = 1. (Ribet argues instead through locally algebraic characters and Grössencharacters of type A₀.)

Checks on the statement:

- For E totally real, ε = 1 and det ρ_λ = χ_ℓ, as in R01.6 (e).
- For J₁(13), ε is the character of order 6 of the newform of level 13, with values in ℚ(√−3).

### GT.2/odd — Ribet's Lemma 3.2: the system is odd

**Theorem.** For every complex conjugation c in G_ℚ, ε(c) = 1 and det ρ_λ(c) = −1. Thus ε is even and every λ-adic component is odd in the sense of R01.4.

Construction and proof route:

1. Fix ℚ̄ ⊂ ℂ. The comparison V_ℓ(A) ≅ H₁(A(ℂ), ℚ) ⊗ ℚ_ℓ is E-equivariant and identifies complex conjugation c with F_∞ ⊗ 1, F_∞ the real Frobenius on H₁(A(ℂ), ℚ), an E-linear involution of a two-dimensional E-vector space; hence V_λ ≅ H₁(A(ℂ), ℚ) ⊗_E E_λ with c acting as F_∞ ⊗ 1.
2. det_E F_∞ = +1 would force F_∞ = ±1, but F_∞ ⊗ 1 interchanges H^{-1,0} and H^{0,-1} in H₁(A(ℂ), ℚ) ⊗ ℂ, so F_∞ is not a scalar. Hence det ρ_λ(c) = −1 and ε(c) = 1 since χ_ℓ(c) = −1.
3. For E totally real this is also R01.6/determinant-and-oddness (c) with R01.6 (e); the CM case needs the Hodge decomposition.

Checks on the statement:

- For an elliptic curve over ℚ, det ρ_ℓ(c) = −1.
- Consequence: the newform attached in GT.3 has even character ε(−1) = 1, as weight-two forms must.

### GT.2/absolute-irreducibility — Ribet's Proposition 3.3: absolute irreducibility

**Theorem.** Every ρ_λ is absolutely irreducible, and its commutant as a ℚ_ℓ[G_ℚ]-module is E_λ. For the whole Tate module over an open subgroup H = G_K, the more general comparison is End_{ℚ_ℓ[H]} V_ℓ(A) = End⁰_K(A) ⊗ ℚ_ℓ.

Construction and proof route:

1. Faltings: V_ℓ(A) is a semisimple ℚ_ℓ[G_ℚ]-module and End_{ℚ_ℓ[G_ℚ]} V_ℓ(A) = End⁰_ℚ(A) ⊗ ℚ_ℓ = E ⊗ ℚ_ℓ (FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems R28.4; the version over K is the same theorem over K).
2. V_ℓ = ⊕_λ V_λ with E ⊗ ℚ_ℓ = ∏ E_λ acting factorwise, so each V_λ is semisimple with commutant E_λ; a semisimple module whose commutant is a field is simple, and End_{E_λ[G]} V_λ = E_λ persists after extension of scalars in characteristic 0, which is absolute irreducibility.

Checks on the statement:

- For E = ℚ: V_ℓ of an elliptic curve over ℚ is absolutely irreducible (EllipticCurveModularity R29.6).
- Fails over a field of definition of extra endomorphisms: for a CM elliptic curve over ℚ, V_ℓ restricted to the Galois group of the CM field is reducible over ℚ̄_ℓ.

### GT.2/coefficient-conjugation — Ribet's Proposition 3.4: a_p = ε(p)·ā_p

**Theorem.** Write bar for the canonical involution of E from GT.1. At every good prime p, a_p = ε(p)ā_p. On representations this is V_σ ≃ V_{σ̄} ⊗ σ(ε) for every σ : E ↪ ℚ̄_ℓ, where V_σ = V_ℓ(A) ⊗_{E⊗ℚ_ℓ,σ} ℚ̄_ℓ and σ̄ = σ ∘ bar.

Construction and proof route:

1. A polarization over ℚ gives a G_ℚ-equivariant Weil pairing ⟨ , ⟩ : V_ℓ × V_ℓ → ℚ_ℓ(1) with ⟨e x, y⟩ = ⟨x, ē y⟩ (R01.6/weil-pairing-on-tate-modules; the Rosati involution is the canonical involution by GT.1/totally-real-or-cm and A2/rosati-involution).
2. After extension of scalars this gives V_{σ̄} ≅ Hom(V_σ, ℚ̄_ℓ(1)); as V_σ is two-dimensional with determinant σ(ε)χ_ℓ, Hom(V_σ, ℚ̄_ℓ(σ(ε)χ_ℓ)) ≅ V_σ, so V_σ ≅ V_{σ̄} ⊗ σ(ε).
3. Take traces of Frob_p for p ∉ S ∪ {ℓ}: σ(a_p) = σ(ε(p))·σ(ā_p).

Checks on the statement:

- For E totally real, consistent with ε = 1.
- For a newform with character ε: ā_p = ε(p)⁻¹a_p, the classical relation.

### GT.2/coefficients-generate — Ribet's Proposition 3.5: the traces generate E

**Theorem.** Deleting any finite set S′ containing the bad primes leaves enough Frobenius traces to generate the whole field: E = ℚ(a_p : p ∉ S′).

Construction and proof route:

1. Fix ℓ and let V_σ (σ : E → ℚ̄_ℓ) be the components of V_ℓ ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ. By Faltings (GT.2/absolute-irreducibility) the commutant of G_ℚ is E ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ = ∏_σ ℚ̄_ℓ, so the V_σ are simple and pairwise non-isomorphic.
2. Semisimple representations in characteristic 0 with equal traces are isomorphic (R01.1/brauer-nesbitt-traces), so the trace functions of the V_σ are distinct; by Chebotarev they are distinguished by their values σ(a_p) at Frob_p, p ∉ S′ ∪ {ℓ}. So distinct embeddings differ on ℚ(a_p : p ∉ S′), which is therefore E.

Checks on the statement:

- For J₀(23): a₂ = (−1 + √5)/2 generates E.
- Removing finitely many primes does not change the field.

**Prerequisites:** `GT.2/absolute-irreducibility`; `GT.2/frobenius-polynomial`; `Chebotarev Layer 10`; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.1`.

### GT.2/inner-twist-field — Ribet's Proposition 3.6: F = ℚ(a_p²/ε(p)) is totally real and E/F is abelian

**Theorem.** The subfield F = ℚ(a_p²/ε(p) : p ∉ S) of E is totally real, and E/F is an abelian extension.

Construction and proof route:

1. By GT.2/coefficient-conjugation, the conjugate of a_p²/ε(p) is ā_p²/ε̄(p) = ε(p)⁻²a_p² · ε(p) = a_p²/ε(p), so F is fixed by the canonical involution and is totally real (GT.1/totally-real-or-cm).
2. Adjoin all roots of unity and the square roots of t_p = a_p²/ε(p) to F. This is an abelian extension of F (a compositum of cyclotomic and quadratic extensions). Since ε(p) is a root of unity, its square roots lie in this extension too; a_p = ±√t_p·√ε(p) lies there, including a_p = 0. GT.2/coefficients-generate then places E inside this abelian extension, so E/F is abelian. This is Ribet’s argument, not the claim that √t_p and ε(p) alone generate E.

Checks on the statement:

- For J₀(23), F = E = ℚ(√5).
- For the newform of level 169 with E = ℚ(√3) in Ribet §7, F = ℚ (an extra twist).

**Prerequisites:** `GT.2/coefficient-conjugation`; `GT.2/coefficients-generate`; `GT.1/totally-real-or-cm`; `GT.2/determinant-character`.

### GT.2/residual-irreducibility — Ribet's Lemma 3.7: residual absolute irreducibility for almost all λ

**Theorem.** For an integral model A′, the G_ℚ-action on A′[λ] is absolutely irreducible for all but finitely many maximal ideals λ of 𝒪_E. In dimension one this specializes to the almost-all irreducibility of elliptic prime torsion in R29.1.

Construction and proof route:

1. For almost all ℓ, the ℤ_ℓ-algebra generated by G_ℚ in End(T_ℓ(A′)) is the full commutant of End_ℚ(A′) ⊗ ℤ_ℓ = 𝒪_E ⊗ ℤ_ℓ (FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems R28.6), that is ∏_{λ|ℓ} M₂(𝒪_λ) for ℓ unramified in E, T_ℓ(A′) being free of rank two over 𝒪_E ⊗ ℤ_ℓ.
2. Reducing modulo ℓ, the 𝔽_ℓ-span of ρ̄(G_ℚ) on A′[ℓ] = ⊕_λ A′[λ] is ∏_λ M₂(𝔽_λ), so each A′[λ] is absolutely irreducible. Ribet deduces the same from Faltings' mod-ℓ theorem ([6, Theorem 1, p. 204]).

Checks on the statement:

- Compatible with the parent: for an elliptic curve over ℚ, E[p] is irreducible for all but finitely many p.
- Exceptions occur: X₀(11) has reducible X₀(11)[5] (a rational 5-torsion point).

**Prerequisites:** `GT.2/integral-model`; `FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems R28.6`; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A6`.

**Sources:** [Ribet92](#references), Lemma 3.7, p. 7.

### GT.2/conductor-bound — Bounded conductors of the λ-adic and residual representations

**Theorem.** Let cond(A) = ∏_p p^{f_p(A)}, with f_p(A) the Artin conductor exponent of V_ℓ(A) for an auxiliary ℓ ≠ p. For λ of residue degree one over ℓ, the prime-to-ℓ conductors satisfy N(ρ̄_λ) | N(ρ_λ) | cond(A). Scalar restriction in the proof retains the factor [E_λ : ℚ_ℓ], even when the residue degree is one.

Construction and proof route:

1. f_p(A) is independent of ℓ ≠ p: the H^i(A) form a ℚ-rational strictly compatible system (NeronModelsAndSemistableAbelianVarieties R11.6), and cond(A) is defined from it (R11.5/conductor-import).
2. For p ≠ ℓ, restriction of scalars of V_λ from E_λ to ℚ_ℓ is a direct summand of V_ℓ(A). The Artin conductor is additive and nonnegative, and restriction of scalars multiplies its exponent by [E_λ : ℚ_ℓ] (each inertia-fixed space, monodromy kernel and Swan term acquires that dimension factor). Thus [E_λ : ℚ_ℓ]·f_p(ρ_λ) ≤ f_p(A), so f_p(ρ_λ) ≤ f_p(A). This applies to every λ; residue degree one alone does not imply E_λ = ℚ_ℓ.
3. Reduction does not increase the conductor (ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.3).

Checks on the statement:

- For an elliptic curve E₀ over ℚ, N(ρ̄_{E₀,p}) | N_{E₀} (EllipticCurveModularity R29.1).
- f_p(A) = 0 for p ∉ S.

**Prerequisites:** `NeronModelsAndSemistableAbelianVarieties R11.5`; `NeronModelsAndSemistableAbelianVarieties R11.6`; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.3`; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.6`.

### GT.2/crystalline-at-good-primes — Crystalline with Hodge–Tate weights {0, 1} at good primes; finite flat residual representations

**Theorem.** At a good coefficient prime ℓ, each ρ_λ|_{G_{ℚ_ℓ}} for λ | ℓ is crystalline. After extension through any embedding E_λ ↪ ℚ̄_ℓ its weights are 0 and 1, once each. The λ-torsion of an integral model extends to a finite flat group scheme over ℤ_ℓ. With χ_ℓ of weight 1, this is the regular weight pair (1,0).

Construction and proof route:

1. A has good reduction at ℓ ∉ S, so V_ℓ(A)|_{G_{ℚ_ℓ}} is crystalline with Hodge–Tate weights 0 and 1, each of multiplicity dim A (PadicHodgeTheory R06.6, R06.5/abelian-variety-hodge-tate-weights).
2. The Hodge–Tate decomposition ℂ_ℓ ⊗ V_ℓ ≅ (ℂ_ℓ(1) ⊗ Lie A) ⊕ (ℂ_ℓ ⊗ H¹(A, 𝒪_A)^∨) is E-equivariant, and Lie(A/ℚ) is a one-dimensional E-vector space (dimension count, GT.1/lie-algebra-divisibility), so every embedding τ sees each weight exactly once.
3. A′[λ] ⊆ A′[ℓ], and A′[ℓ] is the generic fibre of the finite flat ℓ-torsion of the Néron model (an abelian scheme over ℤ_ℓ); take the scheme-theoretic closure.

Checks on the statement:

- For E = ℚ: an elliptic curve with good reduction at ℓ has crystalline V_ℓ with weights {0, 1}.
- The weights give Serre weight k = 2 for ρ̄_λ (GT.3/serre-witnesses).

**Prerequisites:** `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.6`; `PadicHodgeTheory R06.6`; `PadicHodgeTheory R06.5`; `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.TangentSpace`; `GT.1/lie-algebra-divisibility`; `GT.2/integral-model`; `NeronModelsAndSemistableAbelianVarieties R11.1`.

## GT.3 — Modular abelian varieties and the modularity theorem

Modularity is defined using modular Jacobians and then proved by the residual Serre/Ribet argument. The structural characterization assumes ℚ-simplicity; the modularity theorem also treats powers through oldform multiplicity. Parametrisation is a pointed morphism from the curve itself.

### GT.3/modular-abelian-variety — Modular abelian varieties over ℚ

**Definition.** For positive N, define modularity of A at level N by the existence of a surjective homomorphism J₁(N) → A over ℚ. Define Γ₀ modularity at N using J₀(N) instead. In each case modularity without a specified level means that such a positive level exists.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: homomorphisms of abelian varieties over ℚ in the sense of Tau Ceti JacobianChallenge layer E; surjective means faithfully flat (equivalently the image is all of A); X₁(N) has genus 0 exactly for N ≤ 10 and N = 12, so J₁(N) = 0 and only A = 0 is modular of such a level.

Required API:

- `AbelianVariety.IsModularOfLevel` (data): A is modular of level N: ∃ surjective J₁(N) → A over ℚ.
- `AbelianVariety.IsModular` (data): ∃ N ≥ 1 with IsModularOfLevel A N.
- `AbelianVariety.IsModularOfLevel.mono` (relation): IsModularOfLevel A N → N ∣ M → 0 < M → IsModularOfLevel A M (levels are positive).
- `AbelianVariety.IsModular.of_isogeny` (functoriality): A ℚ-isogeny A → A′ (or any surjection) transports modularity of A to A′.
- `AbelianVariety.IsModular.quotient` (functoriality): A quotient of a modular abelian variety is modular.
- `AbelianVariety.isModular_iff` (equivalence): For ℚ-simple A of GL₂-type: modular ⇔ isogenous to some A_f ⇔ some V_λ(A) ≅ ρ_{f,λ′} (GT.3/modularity-equivalences).
- `AbelianVariety.IsModularOfLevel.gamma0` (compatibility): Modular of level N for Γ₀ implies modular of level N: pushforward along the finite surjection X₁(N) → X₀(N) gives a surjection J₁(N) → J₀(N) (R14.2).
- `AbelianVariety.IsModular.elliptic` (compatibility): For an elliptic curve over ℚ, being modular for Γ₀ at level N is the formulation (ii) of EllipticCurveModularity R29.6.

Definition tests:

- `IsModular.X0_11` (computation): X₀(11) is modular of level 11 for Γ₀.
- `IsModular.zero` (degenerate): The zero abelian variety is modular of every positive level; J₁(N) = 0 for 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 and N = 12.
- `IsModular.J1_13_not_gamma0` (non-example): J₁(13) is modular of level 13 but not modular of level 13 for Γ₀, since J₀(13) = 0.
- `IsModular.level_not_minimal` (non-example): X₀(11) is modular of level 22 as well as 11: the level in the definition is not the conductor.

Construction and proof route:

1. The definition only names the property. Its basic properties: modular of level N implies modular of every level M with N | M, because the degeneracy map X₁(M) → X₁(N) induces a surjection J₁(M) → J₁(N) (Albanese functoriality, R14.2); a quotient of a modular variety is modular; a variety ℚ-isogenous to a modular one is modular, since a composite of surjections is surjective.

Checks on the statement:

- X₀(11) = J₀(11) is modular of level 11 (for Γ₀ and for Γ₁, via J₁(11) → J₀(11)).
- J₁(13), of dimension 2, is modular of level 13 but not for Γ₀ at level 13 (J₀(13) = 0).

### GT.3/serre-witnesses — Residual Serre witnesses of weight two at bounded level

**Theorem.** Choose an integral model A′. There are infinitely many maximal ideals λ of 𝒪_E with residue degree one above odd good primes ℓ that are unramified in E and for which ρ̄_λ is absolutely irreducible. For each such λ, obtain a normalized weight-two newform g_λ of level N_λ dividing cond(A) and a prime λ′ of K_{g_λ} above ℓ. After embedding both residue fields into 𝔽̄_ℓ, their residual representations are isomorphic. Thus the traces a_p(g_λ) and a_p(A) agree in that field for every p outside S ∪ {ℓ}. The nebentypus is allowed to depend on λ.

Construction and proof route:

1. Λ is infinite: infinitely many primes split completely in E (Chebotarev), and only finitely many λ are excluded by GT.2/residual-irreducibility.
2. For λ ∈ Λ, ρ̄_λ : G_ℚ → GL₂(𝔽_ℓ) is odd (GT.2/odd), absolutely irreducible, finite at ℓ with det ρ̄_λ|_{I_ℓ} = χ̄_ℓ (GT.2/crystalline-at-good-primes; ε is unramified at ℓ ∉ S), so Serre's weight is k(ρ̄_λ) = 2 (AlgebraicModularFormsAndSerreWeights R15.4) and its level N(ρ̄_λ) divides cond(A) (GT.2/conductor-bound).
3. The strong form of Serre's conjecture (ClassicalSerreModularity R27.6) gives g_λ of weight k(ρ̄_λ) = 2 and level N(ρ̄_λ); compare traces of Frobenius (R01.6 (f), R19.1). The comparison is over a common algebraic closure 𝔽̄_ℓ; Serre does not assert that the newform’s residue field is already 𝔽_ℓ.

Checks on the statement:

- For dim A = 1 the witnesses have trivial character, as in the parent (ε = 1).
- For J₀(23) and λ above ℓ ≡ ±1 mod 5, g_λ can be taken to be the newform of level 23.

### GT.3/fixed-newform — One newform for infinitely many λ

**Theorem.** From the witnesses choose one normalized weight-two newform f, of level N_f dividing cond(A), that occurs for an infinite subset Λ_f. For each λ in this subset there is a ring homomorphism φ_λ : 𝒪_{K_f} → 𝔽_λ = 𝔽_ℓ carrying a_p(f) to the reduction of a_p(A) for all p outside S ∪ {ℓ}. These maps use the whole ring of integers; the finite coefficient-order index is excluded before choosing the infinite subset.

Construction and proof route:

1. The native cusp-form spaces already decompose into diamond-character spaces by isInternal_cuspFormCharSpace. ModularForms Layer 4 must export finiteness of normalized weight-two newforms of positive level dividing cond(A), using finite-dimensionality of the finitely many spaces S₂(Γ₁(M)), M | cond(A). This is finiteness on the existing carrier, rather than a new character decomposition.
2. λ ↦ g_λ maps the infinite set Λ to this finite set, so some fibre is infinite (EllipticCurveModularity R29.3). At this point reduction lands in 𝔽_{λ′}, with the good Hecke values in its embedded subfield 𝔽_λ.
3. Choose finitely many good-prime a_p(f) generating K_f: use GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type, the Frobenius comparison of ModularCurvesPartII R14.5, and GT.2/coefficients-generate applied to A_f. The order they generate has finite index in 𝒪_{K_f}. Delete the finitely many λ whose residue characteristic divides this index or is one of the chosen primes. The remaining Λ_f is infinite, and reduction of every element of 𝒪_{K_f} lies in the embedded 𝔽_λ. Thus φ_λ has the stated codomain 𝔽_λ = 𝔽_ℓ.

Checks on the statement:

- For dim A = 1 this is the parent's pigeonhole step.
- The level of f divides cond(A); its exact value is GT.4/exact-level.

### GT.3/coefficient-identification — Exact coefficients: K_f ≅ E with a_p(f) ↦ a_p(A)

**Theorem.** The infinitely many reductions determine a field isomorphism j : K_f ≃ E. For every p outside S with p ∤ N_f, it satisfies j(a_p(f)) = a_p(A) and j(ε_f(p)) = ε(p).

Construction and proof route:

1. For λ ∈ Λ_f the pair (φ_λ, 𝒪_E → 𝔽_λ) is a ring map 𝒪_{K_f} ⊗_ℤ 𝒪_E → 𝔽_ℓ; its kernel m_λ lies over a prime of exactly one factor L_i of the étale algebra K_f ⊗_ℚ E = ∏ L_i, so infinitely many m_λ lie over one factor L with embeddings u : K_f → L, v : E → L (EllipticCurveModularity R29.3).
2. For p ∉ S, p ∤ N_f, the element u(a_p(f)) − v(a_p(A)) ∈ 𝒪_L lies in primes above infinitely many ℓ, hence vanishes (EllipticCurveModularity R29.3).
3. K_f is generated by these a_p(f) (ModularCurvesPartII R14.5 with GT.2/coefficients-generate applied to A_f, GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type) and E by these a_p(A) (GT.2/coefficients-generate), so u(K_f) = v(E) and j = v⁻¹ ∘ u. To identify characters, first use the resulting equality of good traces and Chebotarev–Brauer–Nesbitt (R01.5) to identify the characteristic-zero representations. Their determinants then identify j(ε_f) with ε. Trace congruences alone do not give determinant congruences.

Checks on the statement:

- For dim A = 1, K_f = ℚ and a_p(f) = a_p(A): the parent's exact equality.
- For J₀(23) and its newform f, j is the identity of ℚ(√5) once E is identified with the Hecke field through the Hecke action; j is unique, as the a_p generate.

**Sources:** [Ribet92](#references), proof of Theorem 4.4, p. 8.

### GT.3/tate-module-comparison — Comparison of λ-adic representations with those of the newform

**Theorem.** For every prime λ of E, the coefficient identification j gives an isomorphism of E_λ[G_ℚ]-modules ρ_λ ≃ ρ_{f,j⁻¹(λ)} ⊗_{K_{f,j⁻¹(λ)}} E_λ. Taking all components over ℓ yields V_ℓ(A) ≃ V_ℓ(A_f) over ℚ_ℓ, with the field actions intertwined by j.

Construction and proof route:

1. Both ρ_λ and ρ_{f,j⁻¹λ} ⊗ E_λ are semisimple (GT.2/absolute-irreducibility; R19.1/newform-rank-two-realisation) and unramified outside a finite set with traces of Frob_p equal to a_p(A) = j(a_p(f)) for almost all p; Chebotarev and Brauer–Nesbitt (ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.5, R01.1/brauer-nesbitt-traces) make them isomorphic.
2. Sum over λ | ℓ, using V_ℓ(A) = ⊕ V_λ (R01.6) and V_ℓ(A_f) ≅ ⊕ ρ_{f,λ} (AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.6).

Checks on the statement:

- For dim A = 1: V_r(E) ≅ V_r(f), as in R29.4.
- The isomorphism need not respect a chosen integral structure; only rational Tate modules are compared.

### GT.3/modularity-theorem — Modularity of abelian varieties of GL₂-type (Ribet's Theorem 4.4, Khare–Wintenberger Corollary 10.2(i))

**Theorem.** If A is ℚ-simple of GL₂-type, there is a normalized weight-two newform f on Γ₁(N_f) and a ℚ-isogeny A_f → A. The isomorphism K_f ≃ End⁰_ℚ(A) identifies the Hecke action with the endomorphism action. Composing with J₁(N_f) → A_f makes A modular at N_f. Every GL₂-type variety over ℚ is modular, including the powers described in GT.1; the latter conclusion uses enough oldform copies at a suitable larger level.

Construction and proof route:

1. GT.3/tate-module-comparison gives V_ℓ(A) ≅ V_ℓ(A_f) as ℚ_ℓ[G_ℚ]-modules; Faltings' isogeny criterion (FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems R28.4) gives a ℚ-isogeny φ : A_f → A. It intertwines K_f and E through j: x ↦ φxφ⁻¹ is a field isomorphism K_f → E carrying the E-linear trace a_p(f) of Frobenius on V_ℓ(A_f) to that on V_ℓ(A), which is a_p(A) = j(a_p(f)), and the a_p(f) generate K_f.
2. Compose the quotient J₁(N_f) → A_f (ModularCurvesPartII R14.5) with φ to obtain a surjection J₁(N_f) → A.
3. For non-simple A of GL₂(E)-type, A is isogenous to Bⁿ with B ℚ-simple of GL₂-type (GT.1/ribet-theorem-2-1), and B ~ A_f with f of level N. In J₁(N·2^{n−1}) the factor A_f occurs with multiplicity d(2^{n−1}) = n (GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type), so A_fⁿ, hence A, is a quotient of J₁(N·2^{n−1}).

Checks on the statement:

- J₀(23) is isogenous to A_f for the newform of level 23 with K_f = ℚ(√5).
- Dimension one: every elliptic curve over ℚ is modular (EllipticCurveModularity R29.6).
- Ribet's example of level 81: A_f with E = ℚ(√3) is its own instance.

**Prerequisites:** `GT.3/tate-module-comparison`; `FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems R28.4`; `ModularCurvesPartII R14.5`; `GT.3/modular-abelian-variety`; `GT.1/ribet-theorem-2-1`; `GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type`.

### GT.3/modularity-equivalences — Equivalent forms of modularity

**Theorem.** For a ℚ-simple GL₂-type A, modularity is equivalent to each of the following: being ℚ-isogenous to some weight-two A_f; having one λ-adic component isomorphic, after extension to ℚ̄_ℓ, to a component of a weight-two newform representation; having such a realization for every λ; and being isomorphic to a ℚ-simple quotient of some J₁(N). The representation comparison always uses primes above the same ℓ. The implications between these assertions use no Serre modularity theorem; GT.3/modularity-theorem proves that they hold.

Construction and proof route:

1. (a) ⇒ (b): a surjection J₁(N) → A and the isogeny decomposition of J₁(N) (GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type) give a nonzero map A_g → A for some newform g of level dividing N (A6: Hom between non-isogenous simple varieties vanishes), hence A ~ A_g as both are simple (A6/endomorphisms-of-simple-abelian-varieties).
2. (b) ⇒ (d): V_ℓ(A) ≅ V_ℓ(A_f) decomposes compatibly with the endomorphism fields (R19.6). (d) ⇒ (c) is trivial. For (c) ⇒ (b), fix the embeddings τ : E → ℚ̄_ℓ and τ′ : K_f → ℚ̄_ℓ of the given isomorphism. Their good Frobenius traces agree. E and K_f are each generated by these traces off a common finite exceptional set (GT.2/coefficients-generate, applied also to A_f using GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type and R14.5/newform-hecke-prime). Thus τ(E) = τ′(K_f), giving j = τ⁻¹τ′ with exact good coefficients. GT.3/tate-module-comparison, followed by Faltings, gives A ~ A_f. This argument needs no infinite residual congruences and no Serre theorem.
3. (b) ⇒ (e) ⇒ (a): compose J₁(N) → A_f with the isogeny; an isogeny image of a quotient is a quotient.

Checks on the statement:

- For dim A = 1 these are formulations (i)–(ii) of R29.6.
- (c) for a single λ of degree one already suffices.

### GT.3/simple-quotients-characterisation — The ℚ-simple quotients of the J₁(N) are the GL₂-type varieties (generalised Shimura–Taniyama–Weil)

**Theorem.** A variety B over ℚ is a ℚ-simple quotient of a positive-level J₁(N) precisely when it is ℚ-simple of GL₂-type. The assignment f ↦ A_f induces a bijection between coefficient-conjugacy orbits of normalized weight-two newforms, over all levels and characters, and the ℚ-isogeny classes of these varieties.

Construction and proof route:

1. ⇒: a ℚ-simple quotient of J₁(N) is isogenous to some A_f (proof of GT.3/modularity-equivalences (a) ⇒ (b)), which is of GL₂(K_f)-type (GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type); GL₂-type is an isogeny invariant (R25.5).
2. ⇐: GT.3/modularity-theorem.
3. Bijection: A_f ~ A_g iff V_ℓ(A_f) ≅ V_ℓ(A_g) (Faltings) iff the eigenvalue systems of f and g are Galois-conjugate (Chebotarev, Brauer–Nesbitt), iff g ∈ [f] by strong multiplicity one (Tau Ceti ModularForms layer 5).
4. Use the library fixed-level/nebentypus strong multiplicity-one theorem where its good-index hypotheses apply; comparison across levels from agreement at almost all primes uses the cross-level form from ModularForms Layer 5.

Checks on the statement:

- Level 11: the only simple quotient up to isogeny of J₁(11) is X₀(11).
- Non-example: E₁ × E₂ for non-isogenous elliptic curves is a quotient of some J₁(N) but not a simple one.

### GT.3/trivial-character — Totally real endomorphism field, trivial character and quotients of J₀(N)

**Theorem.** For ℚ-simple GL₂-type A, total reality of E, triviality of ε, and Γ₀ modularity are equivalent. When they hold, A is a quotient of J₀(N_f). Applying the conductor theorem in GT.4 identifies this level as cond(A)^{1/dim A}. This gives the higher-dimensional content of Serre’s Théorème 5 and specializes to the parent’s quotient at the elliptic conductor.

Construction and proof route:

1. (a) ⇒ (b): with Rosati trivial on E the Weil pairing makes ∧²_{E_λ} V_λ ≅ E_λ(1) (R01.6 (e)), so det ρ_λ = χ_ℓ.
2. (b) ⇒ (a): ε = 1 gives a_p = ā_p (GT.2/coefficient-conjugation), so the canonical involution fixes E = ℚ(a_p) (GT.2/coefficients-generate) and E is totally real (GT.1/totally-real-or-cm).
3. (b) ⇔ (c): A ~ A_f with ε_f = ε via j (GT.3/coefficient-identification); for trivial ε_f, A_f is isogenous to the quotient of J₀(N_f) (ModularCurvesPartII R14.5); conversely a simple quotient of J₀(N) is isogenous to some A_g with g of trivial character.

Checks on the statement:

- J₀(23): E = ℚ(√5) totally real, ε = 1, a quotient of J₀(23).
- J₁(13): E = ℚ(√−3), ε of order 6, not a quotient of any J₀(N).

**Prerequisites:** `GT.3/modularity-theorem`; `GT.3/coefficient-identification`; `GT.2/coefficient-conjugation`; `GT.2/coefficients-generate`; `GT.1/totally-real-or-cm`; `ModularCurvesPartII R14.5`; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.6`.

### GT.3/modular-parametrisation — Modular parametrisation of a GL₂-type variety

**Theorem.** Suppose dim A > 0 and q : J₁(N) → A is surjective over ℚ. For the rational cusp c and its pointed Abel–Jacobi map, φ = q ∘ AJ_c : X₁(N) → A satisfies φ(c) = 0. It is nonconstant and its image generates A. If A is ℚ-simple of GL₂-type, q can be chosen through a degeneracy map to J₁(M), the newform quotient A_f of level M | N, and an isogeny A_f → A. With ε = 1, use X₀(N) and the cusp ∞ instead. The first assertion also applies to modular powers.

Construction and proof route:

1. The pointed Abel–Jacobi image generates J₁(N) by JacobianChallenge layer F. Its image under q therefore generates A, and φ(c) = q(0) = 0. If φ were constant, it would be the zero map and could only generate the zero abelian variety; positive dimension excludes this.
2. In the ℚ-simple GL₂-type case, from the surjection J₁(N) → A and the newform decomposition of J₁(N), choose a newform f of level M | N with A_f ~ A (GT.3/modularity-equivalences and GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type). Compose AJ_c : X₁(N) → J₁(N), a surjective degeneracy map J₁(N) → J₁(M) (R14.2/jacobian-and-functoriality), J₁(M) → A_f and an isogeny A_f → A. Nonconstancy follows from R14.5/abel-jacobi-composite-nonzero. The ambient modular level N need not be the newform level M.
3. The image of X₁(N) generates J₁(N) (the Jacobian is generated by the curve, Tau Ceti JacobianChallenge layer F), hence its image generates A.
4. For ε = 1 the chosen f has trivial character, so use J₀(N) → J₀(M) → A_f, with AJ_∞ and the trivial-character quotient (R14.5/trivial-character-J0). This gives the Γ₀ parametrisation at the specified ambient level N, not merely at some other level.

Checks on the statement:

- For dim A = 1 and ε = 1 this is the parametrisation X₀(N) → E of R29.5.
- For J₁(13) the parametrisation is the Abel–Jacobi embedding of X₁(13), a curve of genus 2.
- For B × B with B = X₀(11), the level-22 oldform quotient J₁(22) → B × B yields a pointed, nonconstant generating curve map even though the target is not ℚ-simple.

**Prerequisites:** `GT.3/modularity-theorem`; `GT.3/trivial-character`; `ModularCurvesPartII R14.6`; `ModularCurvesPartII R14.5`; `JacobianChallenge Layer F`; `GT.3/modularity-equivalences`; `GT.1/modular-quotient-is-gl2-type`; `ModularCurvesPartII R14.2`.

## GT.4 — Conductors, exact level and L-functions

Except for the explicit dimension-one comparison, A is ℚ-simple of GL₂-type, n = dim A = [E : ℚ], and f, j : K_f ≃ E come from GT.3. These hypotheses apply to the conductor, least level, strict compatibility and analytic product statements. Additional copies in powers are governed by GT.3 rather than by the least-level formula.

### GT.4/conductor-of-gl2-type — Carayol's conductor formula for GL₂-type varieties

**Theorem.** With the simple A and newform f fixed above, for every p and every λ not over p prove f_p(A) = n f_p(ρ_λ) and f_p(ρ_λ) = ord_p(N_f). Here f_p(A) is the Artin exponent of the rational Tate module and the component exponent is measured over E_λ. Consequently cond(A) = N_fⁿ. In particular, a weight-two newform of level N has cond(A_f) = N^{dim A_f}.

Construction and proof route:

1. V_ℓ(A) = ⊕_{λ|ℓ} V_λ as ℚ_ℓ[G_{ℚ_p}]-modules, and the Artin conductor is additive; for an E_λ-representation W viewed over ℚ_ℓ, every term of a(W) (Swan conductor and codimension of inertia invariants, ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.3) is multiplied by [E_λ : ℚ_ℓ]. So f_p(A) = Σ_{λ|ℓ} [E_λ : ℚ_ℓ]·f_p(ρ_λ).
2. ρ_λ ≅ ρ_{f,j⁻¹λ} ⊗ E_λ (GT.3/tate-module-comparison) and the Artin conductor of ρ_{f,λ′} away from ℓ is the prime-to-ℓ part of N_f (Carayol; AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.4 (a)); so f_p(ρ_λ) = ord_p(N_f) for every λ ∤ p, and Σ_{λ|ℓ}[E_λ : ℚ_ℓ] = n.
3. Apply this at each p with an auxiliary ℓ ≠ p.

Checks on the statement:

- J₀(23): cond = 23² = 529 and n = 2, so N(A) = 23.
- J₁(13): cond(J₁(13)) = 13², level 13.
- Elliptic curves: cond(E) = N_f, Carayol's Corollaire 0.8 and EllipticCurveModularity R29.4.

**Prerequisites:** `GT.3/tate-module-comparison`; `GT.3/modularity-theorem`; `AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.4`; `ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.3`; `NeronModelsAndSemistableAbelianVarieties R11.5`.

### GT.4/exact-level — The exact level of a GL₂-type variety

**Theorem.** For ℚ-simple GL₂-type A of dimension n, define N(A) as the positive integer with N(A)ⁿ = cond(A). It equals the level of every newform whose abelian variety is ℚ-isogenous to A. For every M ≥ 1, a surjection J₁(M) → A exists if and only if N(A) | M; hence N(A) is the least parametrisation level. The larger level cond(A)ⁿ in Khare–Wintenberger §10.2 is valid. It is N(A)^{n²}, so for n ≥ 2 it is strictly larger than N(A); the positive-dimensional variety cannot have conductor one. For n = 1 the two levels agree.

Construction and proof route:

1. cond(A) = N_f^n by GT.4/conductor-of-gl2-type, so N(A) = N_f; two newforms f, g with A ~ A_f ~ A_g are Galois conjugate (GT.3/simple-quotients-characterisation) and have the same level.
2. If N(A) | M, the degeneracy map makes J₁(M) → J₁(N_f) → A surjective (GT.3/modular-abelian-variety).
3. If J₁(M) → A is surjective, A ~ A_g for a newform g of level dividing M (GT.3/modularity-equivalences); g ∈ [f] by strong multiplicity one, so N_f = N_g divides M.
4. Use the library fixed-level/nebentypus strong multiplicity-one theorem where its good-index hypotheses apply; comparison across levels from agreement at almost all primes uses the cross-level form from ModularForms Layer 5.

Checks on the statement:

- J₀(23): N(A) = 23 and A is modular of level 23 but not of level 1, …, 22.
- For an elliptic curve E₀ of conductor 11: N(E₀) = 11; KW's level 11¹ coincides.
- For J₀(23): KW's level is 529² while the exact level is 23.

### GT.4/strict-compatibility — The λ-adic system is strictly compatible in the sense of Khare–Wintenberger

**Theorem.** The good-prime polynomials of A lie in E. After some finite extension i : E ↪ E′, its representations, indexed through τ′ ∘ i for embeddings τ′ : E′ → ℚ̄_ℓ, form an E′-rational, two-dimensional, regular, irreducible, odd, geometric strictly compatible system of weights (1,0). For each q choose a Frobenius-semisimple Weil–Deligne parameter r_q over E′, unramified when q ∉ S, such that WD(ρ_{τ′∘i}|_{D_q})^{F-ss} ≃ τ′r_q for every τ′. This includes q = ℓ. The all-place conclusion follows from modularity and allows the finite coefficient extension in Carayol’s theorem.

Construction and proof route:

1. Choose f and j : K_f ≅ E by GT.3/modularity-theorem. R19.3/fixed-eigenform-compatible-family supplies a full strictly compatible family over a sufficiently large number field containing K_f; its statement does not require that field to be K_f. Transport K_f through j, obtaining a finite extension E′/E, and reindex the members by τ′ : E′ → ℚ̄_ℓ using R24.5’s coefficient-extension API and GT.3/tate-module-comparison. Carayol §0.6 distinguishes being defined over a rationality field from being realised there; full comparison at q = ℓ is supplied by R19.3’s coefficient-prime theorem, not by Carayol 1986 alone.
2. Regular, odd and irreducible: GT.2/crystalline-at-good-primes, GT.2/odd, GT.2/absolute-irreducibility.

Checks on the statement:

- For an elliptic curve over ℚ the good-prime polynomials lie in ℚ; the theorem permits enlarging ℚ to realise all local WD parameters. This is stronger local data than the good-prime strict compatibility of R11.6, whose convention must be compared explicitly.
- At p ∥ cond(A)^{1/n} with p not dividing the conductor of ε, r_p has nonzero monodromy (Steinberg type, R19.4 (b)).

### GT.4/l-function — The L-function of a GL₂-type variety

**Theorem.** At every prime p, identify the local factor of L(A,s), defined through inertia invariants of H¹ for an auxiliary ℓ ≠ p, with ∏_{σ:K_f→ℂ} L_p(f^σ,s). For p ∤ N_f the individual factor is (1−a_p(f^σ)p^{−s}+ε_f^σ(p)p^{1−2s})⁻¹; for p | N_f it is (1−a_p(f^σ)p^{−s})⁻¹. It follows that L(A,s) = ∏_σ L(f^σ,s) is entire. Its completion Λ(A,s) = cond(A)^{s/2}((2π)^{−s}Γ(s))ⁿL(A,s) satisfies Λ(A,s) = w_A Λ(A,2−s), with w_A ∈ {−1,1}.

Construction and proof route:

1. H¹ ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ = ⊕_ι ρ_ι^∨ and ρ_ι ≅ ρ_{f,ι∘j} (GT.3/tate-module-comparison); the local factor of ρ_{f,λ}^∨ at p ≠ ℓ is that of f at p (AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.4 (c)).
2. The library CuspForm.hasEntireExtension_qExpansion_coeff gives entire continuation of each native cusp-form Dirichlet series. ModularForms Layer 7 identifies that series with the normalized newform Euler product; the finite product over coefficient embeddings is therefore entire.
3. Use the normalised Fricke companion 𝒲_{N_f} of ModularForms layers 6–7. At weight two its functional equation carries i² = −1; after absorbing the Fricke pseudo-eigenvalue into w_σ it reads Λ(f^σ, s) = w_σ Λ(f^{σ̄}, 2 − s). The embeddings are closed under complex conjugation, so the product is self-dual, and cond(A) = N_f^n gives the displayed completion. Apply this product equation twice to obtain Λ(A, s) = w_A²Λ(A, s). The normalised Euler product is nonzero in its half-plane of absolute convergence, so its continuation is not identically zero and w_A² = 1. Thus w_A = ±1; realness on the real line alone would not prove this.

Checks on the statement:

- For J₀(23): L(J₀(23), s) = L(f, s)L(f^σ, s) for the two embeddings of ℚ(√5).
- For dim A = 1 this is R29.6/l-function-continuation.

### GT.4/parent-compatibility — Compatibility with the parent in dimension one

**Application.** Let E₀/ℚ be elliptic, with conductor N_{E₀}. The dimension-one specialization has endomorphism field ℚ, ε = 1, K_f = ℚ, and f = F_{E₀} at level N_{E₀}. Compare the isogeny and the pointed X₀(N_{E₀}) parametrisation with EllipticCurveModularity R29.5–R29.6 using the same quotient q : J₀(N_{E₀}) → E₀ and the same AJ_∞. In both constructions the curve map is q ∘ AJ_∞. This is a compatibility of chosen data; arbitrary isogenies and parametrisations are not required to be unique.

Construction and proof route:

1. E = End⁰_ℚ(E₀) = ℚ (R29.1), so ε = 1 (GT.2/determinant-character, E totally real) and the newform of GT.3/modularity-theorem has trivial character and rational coefficients.
2. By GT.4/exact-level its level is cond(E₀) = N_{E₀}; by strong multiplicity one it is F_{E₀} of R29.3/newform-of-E, and GT.3/trivial-character gives the quotient of J₀(N_{E₀}).
3. Choose the R29.5 isogeny and quotient q when specializing the Part II construction. Both curve maps are q ∘ AJ_∞ on X₀(N_{E₀}), so their equality and value 0 at ∞ follow from this common construction. Precompose with X₁(N_{E₀}) → X₀(N_{E₀}) for the Γ₁ comparison; this supplies the curve-morphism comparison, not merely equality of newforms.

Checks on the statement:

- X₀(11): the Part II statements return J₀(11) → X₀(11), the identity.
- The Part II route uses the strong Serre theorem with nontrivial characters only when E is CM, never in dimension one.

**Prerequisites:** `GT.3/modularity-theorem`; `GT.3/trivial-character`; `GT.3/modular-parametrisation`; `GT.4/exact-level`; `EllipticCurveModularity R29.6`; `EllipticCurveModularity R29.3`; `EllipticCurveModularity R29.5`.

## GT.5 — ℚ-curves as factors of abelian varieties of GL₂-type

First define the geometric ℚ-curve property. The cocycle and restriction-of-scalars argument then assume non-CM and use a common finite Galois field where all chosen conjugate isogenies are defined. The endomorphism algebra is obtained from those maps; its action on the Lie algebra determines the dimension of the projector image.

### GT.5/q-curve — ℚ-curves

**Definition.** An elliptic curve C/ℚ̄ is a ℚ-curve when each conjugate ᵍC, for g ∈ G_ℚ, is isogenous to C over ℚ̄. A curve C₀ over a number field K ⊆ ℚ̄ has this property when its geometric base change does, including conjugations that move K. Non-CM means End_ℚ̄(C) = ℤ.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: elliptic curves are those of Mathlib (WeierstrassCurve with IsElliptic) or, equivalently, one-dimensional abelian varieties (AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A1); isogenies over ℚ̄ are nonzero homomorphisms; ᵍC is the base change of C along g : ℚ̄ → ℚ̄.

Required API:

- `EllipticCurve.IsQCurve` (data): C over ℚ̄ (or over K ⊆ ℚ̄) with ᵍC ~ C over ℚ̄ for all g ∈ G_ℚ.
- `EllipticCurve.IsQCurve.of_isogeny` (functoriality): If C ~ C′ over ℚ̄ and C is a ℚ-curve then so is C′.
- `EllipticCurve.IsQCurve.conj` (functoriality): ᵍC is a ℚ-curve whenever C is.
- `EllipticCurve.IsQCurve.of_rat` (constructor): A curve with a model over ℚ (more generally with j(C) ∈ ℚ) is a ℚ-curve.
- `EllipticCurve.IsQCurve.of_cm` (constructor): Every CM elliptic curve over ℚ̄ is a ℚ-curve.
- `EllipticCurve.IsQCurve.isogenies_over_galois` (other): For a ℚ-curve with a model over K there are a finite Galois K′ ⊇ K over ℚ and K′-isogenies μ_g : ᵍC₀ → C₀ for all g ∈ Gal(K′/ℚ).

Definition tests:

- `IsQCurve.rational` (degenerate): The base change to ℚ̄ of X₀(11) is a ℚ-curve, with μ_g the identity.
- `IsQCurve.cm` (computation): The curve y² = x³ − x with CM by ℤ[i] is a ℚ-curve; so are all curves with CM by an order of ℚ(i).
- `IsQCurve.twist` (characterisation): A quadratic twist over K of a curve defined over ℚ is a ℚ-curve with μ_g isomorphisms over ℚ̄. In particular, over K = ℚ(√2), the twist of y² = x³ − x + 1 by d = √2 has traces 4 and −4 at the two primes above 7 (d reduces to 3 and 4), and is still a non-CM ℚ-curve: its j-invariant is −6912/23, which is not an algebraic integer.
- `IsQCurve.not_of_squared_traces` (non-example): Let C₀ be non-CM over a quadratic field K and let p = 𝔭·σ𝔭 split, with good reduction at both primes. If a_𝔭(C₀)² ≠ a_{σ𝔭}(C₀)² then C₀ is not a ℚ-curve. For a geometric isogeny to σC₀, the one-dimensional space Hom⁰_ℚ̄(σC₀,C₀) is a G_K-line with finite action in ℚ^×, hence action by {±1}; the two Tate representations differ by this quadratic character, so their good traces agree up to sign. Unequal unsquared traces are not an obstruction to a geometric isogeny.

Construction and proof route:

1. The definition only names the property. Its basic properties: it depends only on the ℚ̄-isogeny class of C; conjugates of a ℚ-curve are ℚ-curves; a curve with a model over ℚ is a ℚ-curve; every CM curve is a ℚ-curve, because ᵍC has CM by an order in the same imaginary quadratic field and all such curves are isogenous. The CM assertion uses the ideal-lattice classification and ideal-isogeny API of ComplexMultiplicationAndExplicitReciprocity CM.1; the fixed embedded CM type is adjusted by conjugation before forgetting the action. For rational j, each conjugate has the same j-invariant; use the library WeierstrassCurve.exists_variableChange_of_j_eq, then the induced pointed coordinate pullback to obtain an actual isogeny.
2. Because ℚ̄-isogenies are defined over a finite extension, a ℚ-curve with a model over K has, after enlarging K to a finite Galois extension of ℚ, isogenies μ_g : ᵍC₀ → C₀ defined over K for all g ∈ Gal(K/ℚ) (Ribet §6).

Checks on the statement:

- Every elliptic curve over ℚ is a ℚ-curve.
- Caraiani–Newton Corollary 7.2.5: a curve E over a quadratic field F with E and σE 5-isogenous is a ℚ-curve.

**Prerequisites:** `WeierstrassCurve.IsElliptic`; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A1`; `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety`; `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.IsIsogeny`; `ComplexMultiplicationAndExplicitReciprocity CM.1`; `TauCeti.Isogeny`; `TauCeti.Isogeny.map`; `WeierstrassCurve.quadraticTwistOf`; `WeierstrassCurve.exists_variableChange_of_j_eq`.

### GT.5/ribet-cocycle — The cocycle of a non-CM ℚ-curve

**Construction.** For non-CM C₀/K, choose K-isogenies μ_g : ᵍC₀ → C₀ over a finite Galois K/ℚ. Form c(g,h) = μ_g ∘ ᵍμ_h ∘ μ_{gh}⁻¹ in Hom⁰. Its value is a nonzero rational scalar, and c is a 2-cocycle for the trivial action on ℚˣ. Inflate its class to continuous H²(G_ℚ,ℚˣ). This class depends only on the geometric isogeny class, independently of the field, model and chosen isogenies. Its degree relation is c(g,h)² = deg μ_g deg μ_h / deg μ_{gh}.

Additional hypotheses and conventions: C₀ non-CM, so End⁰_K(C₀) = ℚ and every element of Hom⁰_K(ᵍC₀, C₀) is a rational multiple of μ_g; μ_{gh}⁻¹ is the inverse in Hom⁰ (isogenies are invertible up to isogeny).

Required API:

- `QCurve.cocycle` (data): c : Gal(K/ℚ) × Gal(K/ℚ) → ℚ^× from the chosen μ_g.
- `QCurve.cocycle_isCocycle` (characterisation): c is a 2-cocycle for the trivial action.
- `QCurve.cocycleClass` (data): [c_C] ∈ H²(G_ℚ, ℚ^×), by inflation.
- `QCurve.cocycleClass_indep` (extensionality): [c_C] depends only on the ℚ̄-isogeny class of the non-CM elliptic curve; it is independent of K, the model C₀ and the μ_g after inflation.
- `QCurve.cocycle_sq` (relation): c(g, h)² = deg μ_g · deg μ_h / deg μ_{gh}.
- `QCurve.cocycleClass_of_rat` (simp): If C has a model over ℚ, [c_C] = 0.

Definition tests:

- `QCurve.cocycle_rational` (degenerate): For a curve over ℚ with μ_g = id, c ≡ 1.
- `QCurve.cocycle_quadratic` (computation): For K quadratic and μ ∘ σμ = [m]: c(σ, σ) = m, c(1, ·) = c(·, 1) = 1.
- `QCurve.cocycle_twist_after_extension` (characterisation): For a non-CM quadratic twist C₀/K of an elliptic curve E₀/ℚ, enlarge K to a finite Galois L/ℚ where a twisting isomorphism φ : C₀,L ≅ E₀,L is defined. Taking μ_g = φ⁻¹ ∘ ᵍφ gives an L-defined family of isomorphisms with c ≡ 1 and [c_C] = 0. The geometric twist hypothesis does not supply K-defined conjugate isogenies.
- `QCurve.cocycle_cm_excluded` (non-example): For a CM curve, End⁰ is an imaginary quadratic field, the values μ_g ∘ ᵍμ_h ∘ μ_{gh}⁻¹ need not be rational, and the construction does not apply.

Construction and proof route:

1. μ_g ∘ ᵍμ_h ∘ μ_{gh}⁻¹ ∈ End⁰_K(C₀) = ℚ, nonzero; the cocycle identity follows from associativity of composition and ᵍ(μ_h ∘ ʰμ_k) = ᵍμ_h ∘ ᵍʰμ_k.
2. Changing μ_g to r_gμ_g changes c by the coboundary of r. Enlarging K inflates. To compare models in the same ℚ̄-isogeny class, first enlarge to a common finite Galois field where the comparison quasi-isogeny φ is defined, then conjugate μ_g by φ and ᵍφ; the cocycle values are unchanged because the scalars are rational. Any remaining choices differ by a rational coboundary. Degrees are multiplicative and deg r = r² on ℚ^× ⊆ End⁰.

Checks on the statement:

- For C₀ defined over ℚ take μ_g = id: c = 1.
- For K quadratic and μ = μ_σ with μ ∘ σμ = [m], c(σ, σ) = m and c = 1 elsewhere (GT.5/quadratic-q-curves).

### GT.5/tate-vanishing-qbar — Tate's theorem: H²(G_ℚ, ℚ̄^×) = 0 for the trivial action, and the splitting map α

**Lemma.** Continuous H²(G_ℚ,ℚ̄ˣ) vanishes when ℚ̄ˣ is discrete with trivial action. Therefore the geometric cocycle has a locally constant splitting α with c(g,h) = α(g)α(h)/α(gh). Enlarge K to a finite Galois field K′ through which α factors. Then ε_C(g) = α(g)²/deg μ_g is a finite-order Dirichlet character, and the field E_α = ℚ(α(g) : g ∈ G_ℚ) is an abelian extension of ℚ.

Construction and proof route:

1. The torsion of M is μ_∞ ≅ ℚ/ℤ with trivial action and M/μ_∞ is uniquely divisible, so H^i(G_ℚ, M/μ_∞) = 0 for i ≥ 1 (use the library’s positive-degree vanishing for discrete ℚ-modules); hence H²(G_ℚ, M) = H²(G_ℚ, ℚ/ℤ) = 0 (GL2AutomorphicRepresentationsAndTransfer R17.5).
2. The image of [c_C] in H²(G_ℚ, ℚ̄^×) vanishes, giving α; a locally constant α factors through a finite quotient.
3. α(g)²/deg μ_g is multiplicative by GT.5/ribet-cocycle (c² = ∂(deg μ)), so it is a character of finite order, a Dirichlet character; α² ≡ ε_C mod ℚ^× makes E_α abelian over ℚ.

Checks on the statement:

- For K quadratic and μ ∘ σμ = [m], α(σ) = √m and ε_C is trivial or the character of K/ℚ according to the sign of m (GT.5/quadratic-q-curves).
- The statement fails for nontrivial action: H²(G_ℚ, ℚ̄^×) with the Galois action is not zero (it contains the Brauer group of ℚ).

### GT.5/restriction-of-scalars-endomorphisms — Ribet's Lemma 6.4: the endomorphism algebra of Res_{K/ℚ} C₀ is a twisted group algebra

**Theorem.** Use a common finite Galois K/ℚ where both the conjugate isogenies and the splitting α are defined. The actual B = Res_{K/ℚ} C₀ is an abelian variety of dimension [K:ℚ]. Its rational endomorphisms identify with ⊕_σ Hom⁰_K(σC₀,C₀). The μ_σ give a basis λ_σ satisfying λ_σλ_τ = c(σ,τ)λ_{στ}, hence End⁰_ℚ(B) ≃ R = ℚ^c[Gal(K/ℚ)]. This algebra is semisimple, and λ_σ ↦ α(σ) gives a surjective ℚ-algebra map ω : R → E_α.

Construction and proof route:

1. B is an abelian variety over ℚ representing S ↦ C₀(S_K) (AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A6), so Hom_ℚ(X, B) = Hom_K(X_K, C₀) for abelian X/ℚ; with B_K ≅ ∏_σ σC₀ (A6/weil-restriction-over-a-separable-extension-splits) this gives End⁰_ℚ(B) = ⊕_σ Hom⁰_K(σC₀, C₀) = ⊕_σ ℚ·μ_σ.
2. λ_σ acts on B_K = ∏_g ᵍC₀ by the matrix sending the factor ᵍσC₀ to ᵍC₀ through ᵍμ_σ; the identity μ_σ ∘ σμ_τ = c(σ, τ)μ_{στ} gives the multiplication table.
3. ω is multiplicative because c = ∂α; it is onto E_α by definition. R is semisimple as End⁰ of an abelian variety (A6).

Checks on the statement:

- For C₀ over ℚ and K = ℚ, R = ℚ and B = C₀.
- For K quadratic, R = ℚ[X]/(X² − m) (GT.5/quadratic-q-curves).

### GT.5/lie-free-rank-one — Ribet's Proposition 6.5 and Corollary 6.6: B_K ~ R ⊗ C₀ and Lie(B) is free of rank one

**Theorem.** Write T = ∏_σ C_σ with each C_σ a copy of C₀ over K. On T let λ_g carry C_σ to C_{gσ} by the rational scalar c(g,σ). The map ι : T → B_K = ∏_σ σC₀ in the isogeny category sends C_σ to the σ⁻¹C₀ factor by σ⁻¹μ_σ. It is R-equivariant for this source action and the structural target action. Taking Lie algebras and descending the semisimple multiplicities proves Lie(B/ℚ) ≃ R as R-modules.

Construction and proof route:

1. On the C_σ factor put h = (gσ)⁻¹. The structural λ_g sends the σ⁻¹C₀ factor to hC₀ through ʰμ_g. Thus λ_gι has component ʰμ_g ∘ ᵟμ_σ with δ = σ⁻¹, equal to ʰ(μ_g ∘ ᵍμ_σ) = c(g,σ)ʰμ_{gσ}. This is the component of ιλ_g from C_σ to hC₀, proving equivariance with the source’s inverse-index convention.
2. Lie(B_K/K) = Lie(B/ℚ) ⊗ K, and through ι it is R ⊗_ℚ Lie(C₀/K) with R acting on the first factor; Lie(C₀/K) is one-dimensional, so Lie(B_K/K) is free of rank one over R ⊗ K, and freeness descends to Lie(B/ℚ) over R. Here R is finite-dimensional semisimple: descent of this module isomorphism follows by comparing simple-module multiplicities in its Wedderburn decomposition, not from a general assertion that free modules descend over every ring.

Checks on the statement:

- For K = ℚ: Lie(C₀) is free of rank one over ℚ.
- For K quadratic, Lie(B) is a free ℚ[X]/(X² − m)-module of rank one, two-dimensional over ℚ.

**Prerequisites:** `GT.5/restriction-of-scalars-endomorphisms`; `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.TangentSpace`; `AbelianSchemesAndArithmeticModuli A6`; `IsSemisimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_pi_matrix_divisionRing`.

### GT.5/ribet-theorem-6-1 — Ribet's Theorem 6.1: non-CM ℚ-curves are factors of GL₂-type varieties

**Theorem.** For a non-CM ℚ-curve, let π be the central projector of R onto the E_α factor. Take the image A of a positive integer multiple of π acting on B. It is a ℚ-simple, primitive GL₂(E_α)-type variety with End⁰_ℚ(A) = E_α and dim A = [E_α:ℚ]. Over K it is isogenous to C₀^{dim A}; thus C is a geometric simple factor of A.

Construction and proof route:

1. R = E_α × ker ω as semisimple algebras; let π be the idempotent of E_α and A ⊆ B the image of mπ for m with mπ ∈ End_ℚ(B); A is nonzero, defined over ℚ, and E_α = πRπ acts on A.
2. E_α acts without multiplicity on Lie(B) (GT.5/lie-free-rank-one), hence on Lie(A), so dim A = [E_α : ℚ] and A is of GL₂(E_α)-type (SmallRamificationAndAbelianVarietyBaseCases R25.5).
3. B_K is isogenous to a power of C₀ (A6/weil-restriction-over-a-separable-extension-splits with σC₀ ~ C₀), so A_K is too, and C₀ is a quotient of A_K. A is primitive: End⁰_ℚ(A) = πRπ = E_α is a field (GT.1/ribet-theorem-2-1).

Checks on the statement:

- For C defined over ℚ: A = C, E_α = ℚ.
- For the ℚ(√13)-curve of Ribet §7 (from the level-169 newform with E = ℚ(√3)), A = A_f of dimension two.

### GT.5/q-curves-geometrically-modular — Ribet's Corollary 6.2, unconditional: ℚ-curves are quotients of J₁(N) over ℚ̄

**Theorem.** Every non-CM ℚ-curve is a geometric quotient of some positive-level J₁(N). More precisely choose a weight-two newform f at level N and a finite Galois K′/ℚ with a model C₀ of C such that (A_f)_{K′} is K′-isogenous to C₀^{[K_f:ℚ]}. The forward assertion follows by applying GT.3 to the projector variety. Ribet’s converse from geometric factors to ℚ-curves belongs to the broader building-block theory.

Construction and proof route:

1. GT.5/ribet-theorem-6-1 gives A over ℚ of GL₂-type with A_{K′} ~ C₀^{dim A}; GT.3/modularity-theorem gives A ~ A_f and a surjection J₁(N) → A over ℚ; compose over K′ with a projection A_{K′} → C₀.
2. CM curves are excluded: they are quotients of J₁(N)_ℚ̄ by Shimura's theorem ([26, Th. 1] in Ribet), which belongs to the CM theory, and Caraiani–Newton count CM curves as modular by definition.

Checks on the statement:

- A curve over ℚ: f its newform, K′ = ℚ.
- The 5-isogenous family of Caraiani–Newton Corollary 7.2.5 consists of such curves.

**Prerequisites:** `GT.5/ribet-theorem-6-1`; `GT.3/modularity-theorem`; `ModularCurvesPartII R14.5`.

### GT.5/quadratic-q-curves — ℚ-curves over quadratic fields (Ribet §7)

**Theorem.** Let K/ℚ be quadratic, σ its nontrivial automorphism, and C₀/K non-CM with a K-isogeny μ : σC₀ → C₀. Write μ ∘ σμ = [m], where m is a nonzero integer. The Weil-restriction endomorphism algebra is ℚ[X]/(X²−m), and the character θ = α²/deg μ has θ(σ) = sign(m). If m is a square, the algebra is ℚ × ℚ and C₀ is K-isogenous to a rational elliptic curve. If m is not a square, B = Res_{K/ℚ} C₀ is a primitive GL₂(ℚ(√m))-type surface, with determinant character ε = θ; its endomorphism field is real exactly when θ is trivial. Imaginary K forces m > 0. Thus in the nonsquare case at least one of K and ℚ(√m) is real, and imaginary K makes B a Γ₀ quotient. In the square case its rational elliptic factors are Γ₀ modular.

Construction and proof route:

1. c takes the value m on (σ, σ) and 1 elsewhere (GT.5/ribet-cocycle); R = ℚ[X]/(X² − m) by GT.5/restriction-of-scalars-endomorphisms, split by α(σ) = √m.
2. (a) m a square: R ≅ ℚ × ℚ, E_α = ℚ, and GT.5/ribet-theorem-6-1 gives an elliptic curve A over ℚ with A_K ~ C₀. (b) R = E is a field and B = A is primitive; B_K ~ C₀ × C₀ with E acting through its regular representation, so det ρ_λ|_{G_K} = χ_ℓ, ε is a character of Gal(K/ℚ), nontrivial exactly when E is imaginary (GT.2/coefficient-conjugation, GT.3/trivial-character), hence ε = θ.
3. (c) If K is imaginary, σ is complex conjugation, C₀(ℂ) = ℂ/L and σC₀(ℂ) = ℂ/L̄, μ is multiplication by some γ ∈ ℂ^×, and m = γγ̄ > 0. Alternatively: if E is imaginary, ε = θ is nontrivial and even (GT.2/odd), so K is real.

Checks on the statement:

- Caraiani–Newton’s imaginary quadratic ℚ-curves with K-defined conjugate isogenies fall under (c): the nonsquare case has E real and ε = 1, while the square case descends to rational elliptic factors.
- Koike's example: E = ℚ(√3) real, K = ℚ(√−3) imaginary (Ribet §7, level 81).
- Shimura's examples with E imaginary and K real (Ribet §7).

## GT.6 — Modularity of ℚ-curves over their fields of definition

The geometric factor from GT.5 identifies Tate representations on a sufficiently small open subgroup. A finite character accounts for their comparison over the original field. Solvable base change and reciprocity turn this comparison into automorphy with all finite local factors. The final quadratic statement includes CM as a separate case.

### GT.6/twisting-lemma — Representations agreeing on an open normal subgroup differ by a character

**Lemma.** Let G be profinite and H an open normal subgroup. Over an algebraically closed characteristic-zero field L with its ℓ-adic or discrete topology, take continuous ρ₁,ρ₂ : G → GL₂(L). If their restrictions to H are isomorphic and absolutely irreducible, there is a character ψ : G/H → Lˣ with ρ₂ ≃ ρ₁ ⊗ ψ. In particular the inflated character has finite order.

Construction and proof route:

1. Hom_H(ρ₁, ρ₂) is one-dimensional by Schur's lemma; G acts on it by (g·φ) = ρ₂(g) ∘ φ ∘ ρ₁(g)⁻¹, H trivially since φ is H-equivariant, so G/H acts through a character ψ.
2. A nonzero φ is injective and surjective (ρ₁|_H, ρ₂|_H irreducible of the same dimension) and satisfies ρ₂(g) ∘ φ = ψ(g) · φ ∘ ρ₁(g) for the character ψ of G/H by which G acts on the line Hom_H(ρ₁, ρ₂); so φ : ρ₁ ⊗ ψ ≅ ρ₂. ψ is continuous as it factors through the finite group G/H.

Checks on the statement:

- ρ₂ = ρ₁ ⊗ η for a character η of G/H recovers ψ = η.
- Fails without absolute irreducibility on H: for ρ₁|_H reducible, Hom_H can be two-dimensional and no character need exist.

### GT.6/q-curve-galois-modularity — The Tate module of a ℚ-curve is a twist of the restriction of a newform's representation

**Theorem.** For a non-CM ℚ-curve C over any number field K and any prime ℓ, choose a weight-two newform f, an embedding ι : K_f → ℚ̄_ℓ and a finite-order character ψ : G_K → ℚ̄_ℓˣ such that V_ℓ(C) ⊗_{ℚ_ℓ} ℚ̄_ℓ ≃ (ρ_{f,ι}|_{G_K}) ⊗ ψ. The restriction of ρ_{f,ι} to G_{K″} remains absolutely irreducible for every finite extension K″/K.

Construction and proof route:

1. By GT.5/ribet-theorem-6-1 and GT.5/q-curves-geometrically-modular there are A_f over ℚ and a finite Galois K′/ℚ containing K with (A_f)_{K′} ~ C_{K′}^{n}, n = [K_f : ℚ]; so V_ℓ(A_f)|_{G_{K′}} ≅ V_ℓ(C)^{n}, compatibly with K_f ⊗ ℚ_ℓ acting on Hom⁰_{K′}(C, A_f) ⊗ ℚ_ℓ, a free module of rank one.
2. Hence ρ_{f,ι}|_{G_{K′}} ≅ V_ℓ(C) ⊗ ℚ̄_ℓ restricted to G_{K′} for every ι (AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.6 and Jordan–Hölder).
3. V_ℓ(C) is absolutely irreducible on every open subgroup: Faltings over K″ gives End_{G_{K″}} V_ℓ(C) = End_{K″}(C) ⊗ ℚ_ℓ = ℚ_ℓ with V_ℓ(C) semisimple (FaltingsFinitenessAndIsogenyTheorems R28.6, R28.6/tate-hom-comparison-for-elliptic-curves). Apply GT.6/twisting-lemma to G_K ⊇ G_{K′}.

Checks on the statement:

- C with a model over ℚ: f is the newform of the model, ψ the quadratic character of a twist.
- For K quadratic and m a non-square (GT.5/quadratic-q-curves), f has K_f = ℚ(√m) and B = Res_{K/ℚ}C ~ A_f.

### GT.6/q-curve-automorphy — Modularity of ℚ-curves over solvable Galois fields

**Theorem.** Suppose K/ℚ is finite, Galois and solvable, and C/K is a non-CM ℚ-curve. Use the f and finite algebraic character underlying ψ from the preceding target. Base change π_f along a prime-cyclic tower and twist by ψ ∘ Art_K. The resulting Π = BC_{K/ℚ}(π_f) ⊗ (ψ ∘ Art_K) is cuspidal of parallel weight two. For every finite place v, its local factor in L(Π,s−1/2) equals that of L(C,s), including bad places. At an unramified v its classical T_v eigenvalue is a_v(C) = Nv+1−#C̃_v(k_v). Consequently C is modular in Caraiani–Newton’s sense, and in the Freitas–Le Hung–Siksek sense when K is totally real.

Construction and proof route:

1. Base change: K/ℚ is Galois solvable, so BC_{K/ℚ} is defined along a prime-cyclic tower (GL2AutomorphicRepresentationsAndTransfer R17.4); at each step the image stays cuspidal because ρ_f restricted to every open subgroup is absolutely irreducible (GT.6/q-curve-galois-modularity), so π_f is never dihedral relative to a step.
2. Fix the one-ℓ isomorphism (f,ι,ψ) from GT.6/q-curve-galois-modularity. The finite image of ψ consists of roots of unity; choose their algebraic lifts compatibly with ι in a finite number field containing K_f, and use global Artin reciprocity to form its finite-order Hecke character. At good v the one-ℓ isomorphism identifies the algebraic trace and determinant of the twisted restricted newform with the rational polynomial of C. Injectivity of the coefficient embedding makes these identities algebraic, so they transport to every auxiliary coefficient prime. R17.6/compatible-base-change then matches the twisted base change Π with this family at good v; R01.5 recognition identifies it with V_ℓ′(C) for every auxiliary ℓ′, using continuity, semisimplicity and the corresponding embeddings and twists.
3. For any finite v over p, now choose an auxiliary ℓ′ ≠ p using the preceding transport, rather than changing the original fixed ℓ without justification. R17.4/local-compatibility identifies rec(Π_v) with the restriction of rec(π_{f,p}) to W_{K_v} twisted by the algebraic character at v; Carayol (R19.4) compares this with the WD parameter of the corresponding ℓ′-adic member. Its identification with V_ℓ′(C) gives equality of the local factors even at bad v (R11.5/local-euler-polynomial).
4. At archimedean places the base change of the weight-two discrete series is cohomological of parallel weight two.

Checks on the statement:

- K = ℚ: Π = π_f ⊗ ψ, recovering the modularity of twists of curves over ℚ.
- K = ℚ(√−11) and the ℚ-curves with x(P) ∈ ℚ of Caraiani–Newton Corollary 7.3.4: Π is a twisted base change from ℚ of a weight-two newform.
- Non-example: for K/ℚ not solvable the base-change step is unavailable and the theorem makes no claim.

### GT.6/quadratic-q-curves-modular — ℚ-curves over quadratic fields are modular

**Theorem.** Every ℚ-curve over a real or imaginary quadratic field is modular in the sense of Caraiani–Newton §1. The conclusion includes their CM alternative. In the non-CM case obtain a cuspidal parallel-weight-two Π on GL₂(𝔸_K) with L(Π,s−1/2) = L(C,s). This supplies the ℚ-curve input to Caraiani–Newton Corollaries 7.2.5 and 7.3.4 and Freitas–Le Hung–Siksek §12.

Construction and proof route:

1. CM curves are modular by definition in Caraiani–Newton's sense.
2. Otherwise K/ℚ is cyclic of degree two, hence solvable Galois, and GT.6/q-curve-automorphy applies.
3. For imaginary K and a K-defined isogeny σC → C, GT.5/quadratic-q-curves gives m > 0. If m is nonsquare, Res_{K/ℚ} C has a real quadratic endomorphism field and is a quotient of J₀(N). If m is square, its endomorphism algebra is ℚ × ℚ: the rational elliptic factors are Γ₀-modular, so their product is a quotient of J₀(N) at a common multiple of their levels. This last conclusion does not turn the split endomorphism algebra into a field.

Checks on the statement:

- Caraiani–Newton Corollary 7.2.5: E and σE 5-isogenous over a quadratic F, so E is modular.
- Freitas–Le Hung–Siksek Lemma 12.1: the real quadratic points of X₀(35) that are ℚ-curves give modular curves.
- Non-example: a quadratic-field curve that is not a ℚ-curve gets no conclusion here.
