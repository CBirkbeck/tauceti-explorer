# Ordinary automorphic forms and ordinary modularity lifting — blueprint

This blueprint covers stages R21.1–R21.6. After five checkpoints, **R21.2 is source-decomposed**; R21.1, R21.3, R21.4 and
R21.5 are partial; R21.6 is not yet read. The roadmap belongs to the restructured family RS-08, whose `keeps` are followed:
- R21.1 only applies the ordinary projector to actual arithmetic modules;
- R21.2 keeps the nearly ordinary and Eisenstein statements that Skinner–Wiles need beyond cuspidal Hida theory;
- R21.3 keeps the ordinary Galois families and deformation rings, in the pseudo-representation formalism the source
  actually uses for reducible residual representations.

The source is C. M. Skinner and A. J. Wiles, *Residually reducible representations and modular forms*, Publ. Math.
IHÉS 89 (1999), 5–126, §§2–8 and Appendix A. It is open access on Numdam as an OCR'd scan; every formula below was checked on the
page images.

## Purpose

Khare's level-one argument and the modern p = 3 branch of Serre's conjecture need modularity lifting theorems for
representations whose residual representation is reducible. Skinner and Wiles prove them with nearly ordinary Hecke
algebras over a totally real field F, localised at an Eisenstein ("permissible") maximal ideal. This roadmap owns that
arithmetic:
- the nearly ordinary Hecke algebra built from definite quaternionic forms;
- Eisenstein maximal ideals and their existence from a p-adic L-function;
- finiteness and freeness statements at those ideals and at auxiliary Taylor–Wiles levels;
- later (R21.3–R21.6), the ordinary Galois families, R = T, and the Skinner–Wiles theorems.

## What the libraries and other roadmaps supply

**Mathlib has:**
- quaternion algebras `QuaternionAlgebra`, finite adeles `IsDedekindDomain.FiniteAdeleRing`, totally real fields
  `NumberField.IsTotallyReal` and `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup`;
- power series rings `MvPowerSeries`, local rings `IsLocalRing`, `Module.Free`, `Module.Finite`, idempotents
  `IsIdempotentElem`;
- character modules `CharacterModule`, the nearest notion to the Pontryagin duals Hom_𝒪(−, K/𝒪) used here;
- fibrewise sums (`Fintype.prod_fiberwise` and its additive form) and Euler's theorem `ZMod.pow_totient`.

Neither Mathlib nor Tau Ceti has definite quaternionic forms, Hilbert modular forms or Hida theory.

    Hida's classification of unit U_p-eigenlines;
  - **PadicFamilies L5:** Hida's totally real control (Skinner–Wiles Proposition 3.3, Corollary 3.4, Proposition 3.7,
    Lemma 3.8) and Wiles' Λ-adic forms;
  - **AutomorphicPadicLFunctions L3:** the Deligne–Ribet p-adic L-function, Hilbert Eisenstein series and their constant
    terms, and Chai's forms with prescribed constant terms;
  - **AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.4:** local–global compatibility away from p;
  - **AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.2 (R21.3):** Wiles' Galois representations of ordinary Hilbert eigenforms;

  - **DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra R03.2 (R21.3):** Schlessinger's criteria.

## Conventions

- **Field and algebra.** F is totally real of even degree d and p is odd. D/F is the quaternion algebra ramified exactly
  at the infinite places; it exists because d is even.
- **Levels.** U ⊆ GL₂(𝒪_F ⊗ Ẑ) is open compact with U_v = GL₂(𝒪_{F,v}) for v | p. U_a = U ∩ U(p^a) and
  U⁰_a = U ∩ U₀(p^a).
- **Coefficients.** 𝒪 is the ring of integers of a finite K/ℚ_p, with uniformiser π and residue field k.
- **Groups at p.** G(U_a) ≅ (𝒪_F/p^a)^× × Z(U_a) via (a b; c d) ↦ (∏_{v|p}(a^{−1}d)_v, a). T_y and S_x are the operators
  of (y, 1) and (1, x) in G(U).
- **Weight algebras.**
  - Λ′_𝒪 = 𝒪[[X_1, …, X_{δ_F}, Y^{(i)}_j]] acts through X_i ↦ S_{x_i} − 1 and Y ↦ T_y − 1.
  - Λ_𝒪 = 𝒪[[T_1, …, T_{δ_F}, Y^{(i)}_j]] is used at a permissible maximal ideal.
- **Twisted modules.** H⁰(X(U_a), R)⁺ is H⁰ with t acting by its adjoint t⁺.

## Layer R21.1: the ordinary projector on quaternionic forms (partial)

Library module: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/OrdinaryModularity/QuaternionicHida`, namespace `TauCeti.OrdinaryModularity`.

**Lemma: the exponent comparison** (node `projector-exponent-comparison`). For t in a finite 𝒪-algebra and m divisible
by the residue degrees of 𝒪[t], lim t^{p^n(p^m−1)} exists and equals L0a's lim t^{n!}. On factors where t is a unit,
t^{p^m−1} ∈ 1 + m and its p^n-th powers tend to 1; elsewhere t is topologically nilpotent. So Skinner–Wiles' e is
L0a's projector and no second projector API is built.

**Construction: the ordinary projector** (node `quaternionic-ordinary-projector`; planet). e = lim T₀(p)^{p^n(p^m−1)}
on H⁰(X(U_a), R), for R finite, R = 𝒪 or R = K/𝒪. It is idempotent and commutes with the Hecke algebra, coefficient
change, pullback and trace.
- *API:* `ordinaryProjector`, `ordinaryProjector_isIdempotentElem`, `ordinaryProjector_eq_factorial`,
  `ordinaryProjector_comm_hecke`, `ordinaryProjector_pullback`, `ordinaryProjector_trace`.
- *Tests:*
  - over k, e is 1 on a line where T₀(p) is a unit and 0 where it is nilpotent;
  - e kills norm-factoring forms;
  - F = ℚ(√5) at level GL₂(𝒪_F ⊗ Ẑ): the icosian order has class number one, so X(U) is a point and the cuspidal part
    is 0, matching S₂ = 0 for ℚ(√5);
  - non-example: over K the powers need not converge, so e is defined on the lattice.

**Lemma: norm forms** (node `ordinary-part-kills-norm-forms`). On functions factoring through the reduced norm,
T₀(p) acts as a positive power of p times a translation. So e kills I^D(U_a, ℤ) ⊗ R, and only S^D = H⁰/I^D survives.

**Construction: the nearly ordinary Hecke algebra** (node `quaternionic-nearly-ordinary-hecke-algebra`; planet).
T₂(U_a, 𝒪) = eT(U_a, 𝒪), which is eT*₂(U_a, 𝒪) through Jacquet–Langlands. The transition maps are surjective, and
T_∞(U, 𝒪) = lim T₂(U_a, 𝒪) receives 𝒪[[G(U)]] and is a Λ′_𝒪-algebra.
- *API:* `quaternionicHeckeAlgebra`, `nearlyOrdinaryHeckeAlgebra`, `nearlyOrdinaryHeckeAlgebra.transition_surjective`,
  `hidaHeckeAlgebra`, `hidaHeckeAlgebra.groupRingHom`, `hidaHeckeAlgebra.lambdaAlgebra`.
- *Tests:*
  - T₂ is commutative and finite over 𝒪;
  - the icosian level-one case;
  - the transition maps send generators to generators;
  - the X_i see only the ℤ_p-free part of Z(U).

**Construction: the pairing and Hecke adjoints** (node `ordinary-hecke-adjoint-pairing`).
⟨f, g⟩_U = Σ c_U(x)^{−1}f(x)g(x), with c_U(x) the stabiliser order. It is perfect when the c_U(x) are units and satisfies
⟨[UgU]f, h⟩ = ⟨f, [Ug^{−1}U]h⟩. So t ↦ t⁺ is an isomorphism, and eH⁰ × eH⁰⁺ → R is a perfect pairing of
T₂(U_a, 𝒪)-modules.
- *API:* `stabiliserCount`, `quaternionicPairing`, `quaternionicPairing_perfect`, `quaternionicPairing_hecke_adjoint`,
  `heckeAdjoint`, `ordinaryPairing_perfect`.
- *Tests:*
  - with a free action the Gram matrix is the identity;
  - on a one-point set with stabiliser order c the pairing is perfect iff c is a unit;
  - the adjoint of a central translation is the inverse translation.

**Lemma: traces** (node `ordinary-trace-compatibility`). tr(U_b, U_a) is independent of the representatives, commutes
with t, t⁺ and e, and is adjoint to restriction: ⟨f, tr h⟩_U = ⟨f|_V, h⟩_V.

**Lemma: the Γ₀(p^a) level drop** (node `ordinary-level-independence`). For a ≥ 2,
U⁰_a(1 0; 0 ϖ)U⁰_a = U⁰_a(1 0; 0 ϖ)U⁰_{a−1}, so eH⁰(X(U⁰_a), K/𝒪) = eH⁰(X(U⁰_1), K/𝒪). The identity comes from
g(1 0; x 1) = (1 0; ϖx 1)g, and it fails for a = 1.

**Theorem: Pontryagin duality of the towers** (node `ordinary-towers-duality`; planet). H_∞ is the direct limit along
pullbacks, and M_∞ = lim eH⁰(·, 𝒪)⁺ is the inverse limit along traces. Once c_{U_a} = 1, M_∞(U) ≅ Hom_𝒪(H_∞(U), K/𝒪)
and M⁺_∞(U) ≅ Hom_𝒪(H⁺_∞(U), K/𝒪).

## Layer R21.2: nearly ordinary and Eisenstein control

Library module: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/OrdinaryModularity/Eisenstein`.

**Definition: nearly ordinary representations** (node `nearly-ordinary-representations`; planet). A v-good line is the
unique line where T₀(p_v) acts by a p-adic unit. It exists iff π_v is a principal series π(η_v|·|^{−1/2}, ξ_v|·|^{−1/2})
or a special π(ξ_v|·|^{−1/2}, ξ_v|·|^{1/2}) with λ_v^{−v}ξ_v(λ_v^{−1}) a unit. π is nearly ordinary if such a line exists
for every v | p, and ordinary if moreover every ξ_v is unramified.
- *API:* `IsVGoodLine`, `IsNearlyOrdinary`, `IsOrdinary`, `vGoodLine_unique`, `isNearlyOrdinary_twist`.
- *Tests:*
  - X₀(11) is ordinary at 3 (a₃ = −1) and not at 2 (a₂ = −2);
  - a twist ramified at p is nearly ordinary but not ordinary;
  - a supercuspidal π_v has no v-good line;
  - two unit eigenvalues cannot occur.

**Comparison: the two Hecke algebras** (node `nearly-ordinary-hecke-algebra-comparison`). The algebra generated on the
v-good vectors is finite, flat, commutative and reduced, and equals eT*_k(U_a, 𝒪) in parallel weight. In weight two it
is R21.1's T₂(U_a, 𝒪). Arithmetic points of T_∞ with finite-order restrictions to Z(U) and (𝒪_F ⊗ ℤ_p)^× correspond to
nearly ordinary π. Higher weights come from Hida's control, requested from PadicFamilies L5.

**Definition: permissible maximal ideals** (node `permissible-maximal-ideal`; planet). Let χ be totally odd with
χ|_{D_v} ≠ 1 for every v | p. A maximal ideal m of T_∞(U, 𝒪) is permissible if three conditions hold:
- m ∩ 𝒪[[G(U)]] belongs to G(U) → Z(U) --χω^{−1}--> k;
- T₀(p_i) − 1 ∈ m;
- T(ℓ) − 1 − χ̃(Frob_ℓ) ∈ m.

The equivalence with ρ̄_m ≅ χ ⊕ 1, and the uniqueness of m, use R21.3's residual pseudo-representation.
- *API:* `IsPermissible`, `IsPermissible.ofLevel`, `IsPermissible.T0_sub_one_mem`, `IsPermissible.T_sub_mem`.
- *Tests:*
  - Ramanujan's τ(ℓ) ≡ 1 + ℓ^{11} mod 691 is the degree-one, weight-12 shape of the condition;
  - χ|_{D_v} = 1 (not p-distinguished) is excluded;
  - E₂(1, χω^{−1}) has eigenvalue 1 + ψ(ℓ)Nm(ℓ) ≡ 1 + χ(Frob_ℓ), so the twist by ω^{−1} sits in the first condition, not
    the third.

**Theorem: existence** (node `eisenstein-ideal-existence`; planet). If ord_π L_p(F, −1, χω) > 0, then T₂(U^χ_a, 𝒪)
has a permissible maximal ideal for some a. The proof runs as follows:
1. Take the weight-n Eisenstein series E_n(1, χω^{−1}) with n ≡ 2 mod (p − 1)p^f.
2. Subtract L(F, 1 − n, ψ) times Chai's form to kill the constant terms.
3. The ordinary projection is a cusp form congruent to the ordinary Eisenstein series.
4. Wiles' Λ-adic forms move the congruence to weight two.
5. Local–global compatibility places it at level U^χ.

**Construction: the weight algebra at m** (node `permissible-weight-algebra`). The central action with ε gives the
character D, with D(Frob_ℓ) = S(ℓ)Nm(ℓ); this is Skinner–Wiles' det ρ^mod. It makes T_∞(U, 𝒪)_m a Λ_𝒪-algebra. The map
Λ′_𝒪 → Λ_𝒪, 1 + X_j ↦ (1 + T_j)^{p^{r_j}}ε(γ_j^{−p^{r_j}}), is compatible, and Λ_𝒪 is free of rank p^{Σ r_j} over it
(E1).
- *API:* `centralDeterminant`, `centralDeterminant_frob`, `permissibleLambdaAlgebra`, `lambdaPrimeToLambda_free`.
- *Tests:*
  - in one variable with r = 1 the rank is p;
  - r_j = 0 gives an isomorphism;
  - D(x) = S_xε(x) on Z(U).

**Theorem: finiteness and freeness at m** (node `permissible-localisation-finite`; planet). T_∞(U, 𝒪)_m is a
torsion-free finite Λ_𝒪-algebra, not asserted flat. Under the fixed-point-free hypothesis, M_∞(U)_m and M⁺_∞(U)_m are
free Λ_𝒪-modules of equal rank: they are free over Λ′_𝒪 by Proposition 3.3, and then free over the regular ring Λ_𝒪 by
Auslander–Buchsbaum.

**Theorem: auxiliary levels** (node `auxiliary-level-freeness`; planet). Take w ∤ p with the Γ₀(w)-type U′ and the
Δ_w-reduced U″. If U′/(F^× ∩ U′) acts freely, M_∞(U″) and M⁺_∞(U″) are free over Λ′_𝒪[[Δ_w]] with Δ_w-coinvariants
M_∞(U′) and M⁺_∞(U′). This is separate from finite flatness over weight space.

**Theorem: characteristic-p primes at auxiliary level** (node `characteristic-p-primes-auxiliary`). This is
Proposition 3.20. A prime 𝔭 ∋ p of T_∞(U″) comes from level U′ when three conditions hold:
- det ρ_𝔭 = χ;
- ψ_1/ψ_2 has infinite order on inertia at some v | p;
- ρ_𝔭 is irreducible and not dihedral.

The proof passes through an auxiliary prime ℓ chosen by Chebotarev.

**Lemma: the trace at tame inertia** (node `auxiliary-trace-identity`). Lemma 3.21 and Remark 3.22: trace ρ^mod(σ_w)
acts on M_∞(U″)_m as δ_w + δ_w^{−1}.

**Construction: the rings T_{𝒟_Q}** (node `deformation-hecke-rings`). This is §3.6.
- The level U_{𝒟_Q} has four local cases: unramified, Σ∖(𝒫 ∪ ℳ), ℳ and Q.
- T_{𝒟_Q} = T_∞(U_{𝒟_Q}, 𝒪)_m, and π_{𝒟_Q} : R_{𝒟^ps_Q} ↠ T_{𝒟_Q}.
- T^min_{𝒟_Q} is the quotient by the minimal primes with χ̃^{−1}det trivial on N_Σ (a nonempty set, by twisting).
- The patching modules are M_{𝒟_Q} = M_∞(U^min_{𝒟_Q})_m.
- *API:* `deformationLevel`, `deformationHeckeRing`, `pseudoToDeformationHecke`, `minimalHeckeRing`,
  `minimalPrimes_nonempty`, `deformationHeckeModule`.
- *Tests:*
  - maximal level outside (Σ∖𝒫) ∪ Q;
  - Δ_w acts at w ∈ Q;
  - twisting reaches ℳ^min.

**Theorem: T_{𝒟_Q} ≅ T^min_{𝒟_Q} ⊗ 𝒪[N_𝒟]** (node `minimal-hecke-ring-decomposition`). This is Proposition 3.23 with
Corollary 3.24 and Lemma 3.25; Gal(L_Θ/F) ≅ N_𝒟.

**Theorem: duality** (node `hecke-module-duality`). This is §3.7: λ_∞, β_∞, (3.16) and (3.17), with
M_∞(U)_m ≅ Hom_{Λ_𝒪}(M⁺_∞(U)_m, Λ_𝒪). Skinner–Wiles quote Proposition 3.3's freeness over 𝒪[[G(U)]], which is not
justified (PadicFamilies E11). The identifications need only Frobenius reciprocity and freeness over Λ′_𝒪.

**Theorem: Ihara's lemma** (node `ihara-lemma-quaternionic`; planet "Ihara's lemma for definite quaternion algebras").
This is Lemma 3.26. ker(f, g ↦ f + αg) is killed by [U(1 0; 0 λ^{(q)})U] − 1 − Nm(q). The proof follows Diamond–Taylor,
using strong approximation for the norm-one group and Eichler's norm theorem (requested from
HilbertModularVarietiesAndShimuraCurves R18.3).

**Lemma: deeper levels** (node `ihara-exact-sequence`). Lemmas 3.27–3.28.

**Theorem: no level raising at a good auxiliary prime** (node `level-raising-congruence-modules`). This is Lemma 3.29.
At ℓ with p ∤ Nm(ℓ) − 1 and eigenvalue ratio ≠ Nm(ℓ)^{±1}, the Hecke algebras at levels U, U_0(ℓ) and U_1(ℓ) agree at
𝔭, and M̂_∞(U^{(0)})_𝔭 ≅ M̂_∞(U)_𝔭².

## Layer R21.3: ordinary Galois and deformation families (partial)

Library modules: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/OrdinaryModularity/{Deformations, HidaGalois}`. The sources are Skinner–Wiles
§§2.1, 2.3–2.5 and §3.3. χ is totally odd with χ|_{D_i} ≠ 1 at every v_i | p.

**Definition: deformation data** (node `deformation-datum`). 𝒟 = (𝒪, Σ, c, ℳ) consists of the coefficients 𝒪, the
ramification set Σ ⊇ 𝒫, an admissible class 0 ≠ c ∈ H_Σ(F, k) and the places ℳ. The class c gives the nonsplit
ρ_c = (1 *; 0 χ), which is Schur but reducible.
- *API:* `DeformationDatum`, `admissibleClasses`, `residualExtension`, `residualExtension_schur`,
  `residualExtension_local_split`.
- *Tests:*
  - c = 0 is excluded;
  - ρ_c(z_1) = diag(1, −1);
  - Ribet's class for p = 691, χ = ω^{11} over ℚ is admissible.

**Construction: nearly ordinary deformations** (node `deformation-of-type`; planet "Nearly ordinary deformation ring
R_𝒟").
- Type 𝒟 asks for ramification only in Σ, the ordered flag (ψ_1 *; 0 ψ_2) with ψ_1 ≡ χ at each v_i, and the shape
  (1 *; 0 χ̃) on I_w for w ∈ ℳ.
- R_𝒟 exists by Schur representability (GlobalGaloisDeformations R04.2).
- Variants: R_{𝒟_Q} adds auxiliary primes Q, and R^min is the minimal ring, with R_{𝒟_Q} ≅ R^min_{𝒟_Q} ⊗ 𝒪[N_Σ].
- Skinner–Wiles' "det ρ trivial on N_Σ" means χ̃^{−1}det ρ.
- *API:* `IsOfType`, `universalRing`, `universalRing_represents`, `universalRingAux`, `universalRingMin`.
- *Tests:*
  - ρ_c itself is of type 𝒟;
  - the wrong flag order is not;
  - restriction to a permissible F′ gives type 𝒟′;
  - twisting moves between the N_Σ-components.

**Definition: permissible extensions** (node `permissible-extension`). These are the conditions under which 𝒟 base
changes to a totally real F′/F (Remark 2.1).
- *API:* `IsPermissibleExtension`, `DeformationDatum.baseChange`, `isOfType_baseChange`.
- *Tests:*
  - F itself is permissible;
  - a field splitting ρ_c is not;
  - a field where χ becomes trivial at some w | p is not.

**Theorem: presentation and dimension** (node `global-presentation-bound`; planet). R_𝒟 ≅ 𝒪[[x_1, …, x_g]]/(f_1, …, f_r)
with g − r ≥ d + δ_F − 2t − 3·#ℳ (Proposition 2.4). The proof has four steps:
1. Mazur's presentation of the fixed-determinant auxiliary ring.
2. d + 2t local nearly ordinary relations (Corollary 2.3, requested from LocalGaloisDeformationRings L8).
3. Tensor with 𝒪[[Gal(L(Σ)/F)]] to free the determinant.
4. Add 3·#ℳ relations at ℳ, and finish with the global Euler characteristic.

**Lemma: matrix entries** (node `matrix-entry-subring`). R_𝒟 is generated over the completed subring of matrix entries
(Lemmas 2.5–2.6).

**Definition: ramification types** (node `ramification-types`). Types A (unipotent), B (φ ⊕ 1), B′ (φ ⊕ φ^{−1}) and C
(induced from the unramified quadratic extension, characteristic 0 only).
- *API:* `RamificationType`, `ramificationType_of_pseudo`, `typeC_charZero`.
- *Tests:*
  - Tate curves give type A;
  - π(μ, 1) with μ tamely ramified gives type B;
  - type C is impossible in characteristic p.

**Definition: pseudo-representations** (node `pseudo-representation`; planet "Wiles pseudo-representation"). A
pseudo-representation is ρ = {a, d, x} satisfying Wiles' seven identities. Its trace is a + d and its determinant is
a(σ)d(σ) − x(σ, σ). A representation with ρ(z_1) = diag(1, −1) gives {a_σ, d_σ, b_σc_τ}. Pseudo-deformations are those
of ρ_0 = {1, χ, 0}, of type 𝒟^ps = (𝒪, Σ). The trace is an IHG.0 pseudocharacter.
- *API:* `PseudoRep`, `PseudoRep.trace`, `PseudoRep.det`, `PseudoRep.ofRep`, `PseudoRep.ofRep_conj_diagonal`,
  `PseudoRep.trace_isPseudocharacter`.
- *Tests:*
  - the fourth identity is the expansion of b_{στ}c_{αβ} (proved in the Lean file);
  - all ρ_c share ρ_0;
  - the determinant of ofRep is det;
  - diagonal conjugation leaves ofRep unchanged.

**Theorem: the universal pseudo-deformation ring** (node `universal-pseudo-deformation`). The functor satisfies
Schlessinger's criteria, with tangent dimension at most 4·#Gal(F(χ)/F) + 2s² + 4 (Lemma 2.10). The proof gives the
sharper bound s² + 4s + 4·#Gal(F(χ)/F).

**Construction: r_𝒟** (node `pseudo-to-deformation-map`). The map R_{𝒟^ps} → R_𝒟 is well defined because bases with
ρ(z_1) = diag(1, −1) differ diagonally. It does not see c.
- *API:* `pseudoToDeformation`, `pseudoToDeformation_unique`, `pseudoToDeformation_aux`.
- *Tests:*
  - it is the identity modulo maximal ideals;
  - it is independent of the basis;
  - it does not detect c.

**Theorem: localisation at irreducible primes** (node `pseudo-deformation-localisation`). At a one-dimensional 𝔭 with
ρ mod 𝔭 irreducible, R̂^ps_{𝔭^ps} ↠ R̂_{𝒟_Q,𝔭} (Proposition 2.11). Hence dim R^ps/Q^ps ≥ dim R_𝒟/Q (Corollary 2.12).

**Lemma: lattices** (node `lattice-reduction-lemma`). An irreducible ρ with reduction 1 ⊕ χ has a lattice with
nonsplit reduction (1 *; 0 χ), and its extension class is unique up to scalars (Lemma 2.13). Hence pseudo-deformations
over a DVR with x ≠ 0 come from deformations of some ρ_c (Corollary 2.14).

**Theorem: lifting pseudo-deformations** (node `pseudo-deformation-lifting`; planet). At a one-dimensional prime with
x ≢ 0, a pseudo-deformation (R, ρ) lifts to a deformation ρ⁺ of some ρ_c over a domain R⁺ ⊇ R of the same dimension,
built by blowing up and completing. With (2.8)–(2.9), ρ⁺ is of type 𝒟_Q (Proposition 2.15).

**Construction: Λ_𝒪-structures** (node `deformation-iwasawa-algebra`). T_i ↦ det(γ_i) − 1 and Y ↦ ψ_2(y) − 1 on R_𝒟.
On R_{𝒟^ps} the Y-variables use the roots α_i, β_i at g_i: (tr(g_iσ) − α_i tr σ)/(β_i − α_i) = ψ_2(σ). The structures
are compatible with r_𝒟 and with level change.
- *API:* `deformationLambdaAlgebra`, `pseudoLambdaAlgebra`, `pseudoToDeformation_lambda`, `lambdaAlgebra_levelChange`.
- *Tests:*
  - the upper-triangular identity (proved in the Lean file);
  - r_i = 0;
  - the variables vanish residually.

**Construction: Hida's family representation** (node `hida-family-representation`; planet). For every prime Q of
T_∞(U, 𝒪), ρ_Q : Gal(F̄/F) → GL₂(L̄) is semisimple with the properties (3.4)(i)–(vi): trace T(ℓ), determinant
S(ℓ)Nm(ℓ) and S_xε(x), and the flag at each v_i with ψ_2(y) = T_y and ψ_2(λ_{𝔭_i}) = T_0(𝔭_i). The construction:
- algebraic primes of weight 2 use Wiles' ρ_π (requested from AutomorphicGaloisRepresentations R19.2);
- minimal primes glue over the dense weight-two points;
- the flag (vi) comes from a nonsplit-reduction argument.
- *API:* `hidaGaloisRep`, `hidaGaloisRep_trace`, `hidaGaloisRep_det`, `hidaGaloisRep_nearlyOrdinary`,
  `hidaGaloisRep_specialise`.
- *Tests:*
  - ρ_Q(z_1) = diag(1, −1);
  - it specialises to ρ_π in weight two;
  - ψ_2 ≡ 1 modulo a permissible ideal.

**Construction: the pseudo-representation into T_m** (node `hecke-pseudo-representation`). ρ^mod_m is obtained by
patching over the minimal primes in m (3.5). For permissible m it gives the Λ_𝒪-algebra map
R_{𝒟^ps} → T_∞(U, 𝒪)_m (3.6).
- *API:* `heckePseudoRep`, `heckePseudoRep_trace`, `pseudoToHecke`, `pseudoToHecke_lambda`.
- *Tests:*
  - the residual pseudo-representation is {1, χ, 0};
  - specialisation gives ρ_Q;
  - the determinant is S(ℓ)Nm(ℓ).

**Lemma: permissible = residually χ ⊕ 1** (node `permissible-residual-comparison`). (3.9) is equivalent to
ρ̄_m ≅ χ ⊕ 1, and a permissible ideal is unique. This closes R21.2's deferral.

**Theorem: generation and surjectivity** (node `hecke-generation`; planet "Surjectivity of R^ps → T_m").
T_∞(U, 𝒪)_m is generated over Λ_𝒪 by T(ℓ), S(ℓ) with ℓ ∉ S (Lemma 3.11). Its proof uses
T_y = (β_i − α_i)^{−1}(β_i tr ρ(σ_y) − tr ρ(g_iσ_y)); the source omits the inverse (E3). Hence level change and (3.6)
are surjective (Corollaries 3.12–3.13).

**Theorem: level by type** (node `level-type-control`). A minimal prime comes from the level fixed by its type at w:
unramified, A, B or C (Proposition 3.14), or U′_w for type B′ with p-power φ (Proposition 3.15).

**Lemma: inertia at auxiliary levels** (node `inertia-character-constraints`). Lemma 3.16.

**Lemma: twisting** (node `family-twisting`). ρ_Q ⊗ Ψ occurs at level U ∩ U_1(cond^{(p)}(Ψ)²) (Lemma 3.17). The
twist multiplies T_0(𝔭_i) by Ψ_P(λ_{𝔭_i}); the source prints the inverse (E4).

**Lemma: the reducible locus** (node `reducible-locus-dimension`). This is Lemmas 2.7–2.9.
- dim R^red_𝒟 ≤ 1 + 2δ_F + dim H_Σ(F, k).
- Reducible primes with finite-order determinant have dimension ≤ δ_F + dim H_Σ.
- Diagonal deformations have dimension ≤ 1 + 2δ_F, or ≤ δ_F with finite-order determinant.

## Layer R21.4: pro-modularity and R = T (partial)

Library module: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/OrdinaryModularity/ProModularity`. The source is Skinner–Wiles §§4.1–4.3 and
Appendix A.

**Definition: pro-modular primes** (node `pro-modular-prime`; planet). q ⊆ R_𝒟 is pro-modular if the pseudo-deformation
map R_{𝒟^ps} → R_𝒟/q factors through T_𝒟. The property passes to larger primes and to components.
- *API:* `IsProModular`, `IsProModular.of_le`, `IsProModularComponent`, `IsProModular.trace`.
- *Tests:*
  - the maximal ideal is pro-modular;
  - pro-modularity specialises;
  - it does not see the extension class.

**Definition: good pairs and nice primes** (node `good-pair-and-nice-primes`; planet). Goodness of (F, 𝒟) has five
conditions:
- d is even;
- L_p(F, −1, χω) is a non-unit;
- d > 2 + δ_F + 8(#Σ + dim H_{Σ_0});
- d_{v_i} > 2 + 2t + 7(#Σ + dim H_{Σ_0});
- a ramification condition at w ∤ p.

The node also defines nice deformations and primes, and properties (P1) and (P2).
- *API:* `IsGoodPair`, `IsNiceDeformation`, `IsNiceFor`, `PropertyP1`, `PropertyP2`, `IsGoodPair.mono`.
- *Tests:*
  - no datum over ℚ is good;
  - the local degree bound;
  - nice deformations live in characteristic p.

**Lemma: components meet** (node `raynaud-connectedness-corollary`). This is Corollary A.2. For a local Cohen–Macaulay
ring and r ≤ d − 2 relations, two nonempty classes of components meet in a prime of dimension d − r − 1. Raynaud's
connectedness theorem (Proposition A.1) is cited without proof, and no roadmap plans it, so it is a gap.

**Theorem: the key proposition** (node `pro-modularity-key-proposition`; planet). This is Proposition 4.1. If (F, 𝒟) is
good and (P1) and (P2) hold for 𝒟 and 𝒟_c, every prime of R_𝒟 is pro-modular. The proof combines:
- dimension counting with Proposition 2.4 and Corollary A.2;
- irreducibility at large-dimensional primes (Lemmas 2.6–2.8);
- Corollary 2.12, which is printed as "Proposition 2.12" (E5);
- the Λ_𝒪-structure, to find a nice prime.

**Theorem: the criterion for (P2)** (node `p2-criterion`; planet). This is Proposition 4.2: if (F, 𝒟) is good and (P1)
holds for all data with smaller Σ, then (P2) holds for 𝒟. There are three steps:
1. The Eisenstein ideal of χ gives a nice pro-modular prime for 𝒟_0.
2. Linear conditions and the dimension bounds produce a deformation of ρ_c.
3. Show that deformation is of type 𝒟_c and pro-modular, via the level statements.

**Theorem: (P1)** (node `property-p1`). Proposition 8.4 reduces (P1) to Proposition 8.1 (R = T at nice primes) by
twisting.

**Definition: formal patching data** (node `formal-patching-datum`). These are the axioms (5.1)–(5.11) over A = k[[T]]:
- rings R^{(N)}_a, finite free over A, with the level algebras A_N ⊇ B_N;
- trace subrings R^{tr(N)};
- modules M^{(N)}_a, free over A_a ⊗ K;
- the element x^{(N)}.

The patching is on deformation rings. Abstract patching is imported from DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra R03.5.

**Theorem: formal patching** (node `formal-patching-theorem`; planet). This is Lemmas 5.1–5.6 and Propositions 5.7–5.9.
R_∞ = K[[x_1, …, x_n]], M_∞ is free, M^{(0)} ⊗ K ≅ (R^{(0)} ⊗ K)^e, and R^{(0)} ⊗ K is a complete intersection. The
proof uses Auslander–Buchsbaum and de Smit–Rubin–Schoof Lemma 4.1 (R03.3).

**Lemma: characteristic-p irreducibility** (node `char-p-adjoint-irreducibility`). This is Lemmas 6.1–6.5, for ρ over
A = k[[λ]]: ad⁰ρ is irreducible, and there are elements with infinite-order eigenvalues in A.

**Theorem: auxiliary primes** (node `auxiliary-prime-sets`). This is Proposition 6.10: there are sets Q of r primes with
Nm(w) ≡ 1 mod p^m, prescribed Frobenius, and lim H_{Σ_Q} ≅ (K/A)^r ⊕ bounded. The proof combines Wiles' formula (6.3),
the local estimates (6.4)–(6.9), Lemma 6.9 and Chebotarev (R04.5).

**Lemma: ψ(𝒟, 𝔭)** (node `minimum-level-surjection`). This is Lemma 7.1: a surjection (R̃^min)_{𝔭̃} ↠ (T̃^min)_{𝔭̃} at a
nice prime, through Proposition 2.15.

**Theorem: R = T at minimal level** (node `minimum-level-r-equals-t`). This is Proposition 7.3, for 𝒟 = 𝒟_c:
- ψ is an isomorphism;
- the ring is a reduced complete intersection over Λ̃_{𝒪,P};
- M̃ is free.

The §5 data are built from the Q_N of Proposition 6.10 and Lemmas 3.19, 3.21 and 3.29.

**Lemma: congruence maps** (node `level-raising-congruence-maps`). This is §8.2: Lemma 8.2 and the maps Φ_i, Φ̂_i, Ψ_i,
Θ_i with the level-raising factors η_i.

**Theorem: R = T at nice primes** (node `nice-prime-r-equals-t`; planet). This is Proposition 8.1. It is proved by
induction along 𝒟_c ≤ ⋯ ≤ 𝒟 with de Smit–Rubin–Schoof Criterion I, via (8.4), (8.5) and (8.7).

**Theorem: the Main Theorem** (node `main-theorem`; planet). Let ρ over any totally real F be irreducible, nearly
ordinary of type 𝒟, with det ρ = ψε^μ, μ ≥ 1. If ρ admits a solvable, even-degree, permissible base change L with
(L, 𝒟_L) good, then ρ is modular. The proof combines:
- Propositions 4.1, 4.2 and 8.4;
- Hida's control (Proposition 3.7);
- Wiles' ρ_π;
- solvable base change (requested from GL2AutomorphicRepresentationsAndTransfer R17.4).

## Layer R21.5: Skinner–Wiles' theorems (partial)

Library module: `TauCeti/NumberTheory/OrdinaryModularity/SkinnerWiles`.

**Definition: Hypothesis H** (node `hypothesis-h`). There are imaginary quadratic extensions with prescribed local
behaviour and relative class groups of p-rank ≤ c(ε)[K:ℚ]^{1−ε}. It is a hypothesis, not a theorem.

**Theorem A** (node `theorem-a`; planet). For F and F(χ_1/χ_2) abelian over ℚ, an irreducible nearly ordinary ρ with
ρ̄^ss ≅ χ_1 ⊕ χ_2, χ_1/χ_2 odd and p-distinguished, and det ρ = ψε^{k−1} is modular. The good base change is built as
follows:
- take cyclotomic ℤ_ℓ-towers;
- Washington's theorem (a gap) bounds their class groups;
- adjoin abelian p-extensions, which make L_p(L, −1, χω) a non-unit;
- Waldschmidt's bound (a gap) finishes the count.

**Theorem B** (node `theorem-b`; planet). The same for arbitrary totally real F with (χ_1/χ_2)|_{D_v} of even order,
conditional on Hypothesis H. The tower uses totally real quadratic steps.

## Mistakes found in the sources

**E1 (misprint, reaches nothing): Skinner–Wiles §3.2, before Lemma 3.10, p. 41.** "makes Λ_𝒪 a free Λ′_𝒪-module of
rank r = Σr_j" should read rank p^{Σ r_j}. In each variable u(1 + T)^{p^r} − 1 is a unit times a distinguished
polynomial of degree p^r. Lemma 3.10 uses only finite freeness.

**E2 (misprint, reaches nothing): p. 35.** "H⁺_∞(U_a) = lim→ eH⁰(X(U_a), K/𝒪)⁺" should read H⁺_∞(U).

**E3 (misprint, reaches nothing): the proof of Lemma 3.11, p. 42.** "T_y = (β_i − α_i)(β_i trace ρ^mod(σ_y) −
trace ρ^mod(g_iσ_y))" should have (β_i − α_i)^{−1}, and likewise for T_0(𝔭_i). The printed expression is
(β_i − α_i)²T_y. Membership in T^S is unaffected, because β_i − α_i is a unit.

**E4 (misprint, reaches nothing): (3.7), p. 45.** "τ_P(T_0(𝔭_i)) = (T_0(𝔭_i) mod P)·Ψ_P(λ_{𝔭_i})^{−1}" should read
Ψ_P(λ_{𝔭_i}). Twisting by Ψ ∘ det multiplies [U(1 0; 0 λ)U] by Ψ(λ), exactly as the next line does for T_y.

**E5 and E6 (misprints, reach nothing): cross-references.**
- The proof of Proposition 4.1 (p. 64) cites "Proposition 2.12" for Corollary 2.12. The same drift recurs in the proof of
  Proposition 4.2 ("Lemma 2.12", pp. 67 and 70; "Proposition 2.12", p. 69).
- The proof of Proposition 4.2 (p. 66) cites "Proposition 3.14" for Proposition 3.18 (existence of the permissible ideal).

**E8 (misprint, reaches nothing): §8.4, p. 119.** "By Proposition 7.2" should read Proposition 7.3; 7.2 is a Remark.

**E7 (misprint, reaches nothing): the proof of Theorem B, p. 78.** The four conditions are listed as (i), (ii), (iii),
(vi); the last should be (iv).

## Remaining work

- **R21.1 is partial.** Still to do:
  - apply the projector to the modular-curve H¹ towers (ModularCurvesPartII R14.3; Hida 1986) and to the indefinite
    Hilbert and Shimura-curve cohomology (R18.4);
  - odd-degree F.
- **R21.2 is source-decomposed** (checkpoint 3).
- **R21.3 is partial.** The L8 determinant-versus-flag comparison is now planned in LocalGaloisDeformationRings L8, and
  is recorded here only when a consumer needs it.
- **R21.4 is partial.** Only the Raynaud gap remains. The verification of (5.10)–(5.11) and §8.3's commutative algebra
  are summarised inside the proof steps.
- **R21.5 is partial.** Still to do:
  - the p = 3 branch (Dieulefait–Pacetti, with Berger–Li–Zhu);
  - Khare's use of Skinner–Wiles;
  - the Washington and Waldschmidt gaps.
- **R21.6 is not read.**
