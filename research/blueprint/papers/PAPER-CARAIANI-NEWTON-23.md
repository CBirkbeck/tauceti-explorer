Extraction by Claude Code, session `cc-fb70e5`, 29 September 2026 (issue #4490). Status: **complete**. `check_paper.py` passes.

The extraction has 166 items: 1 library, 36 planned and 129 missing. Every missing item is routed once, along six routes. After the independent review it has 169 items (1 library, 36 planned, 132 missing) and eight routes; see the last section.

## What the paper proves

**Main theorems.**
- **Theorem 1.1 (= Corollary 7.1.2).** Every elliptic curve over an imaginary quadratic field F is modular, provided X₀(15)(F) is finite. This covers Q(√−d) for d = 1, 2, 3, 5 and infinitely many other fields.
- **Theorem 1.2 (= Corollary 6.1.2).** Over an imaginary CM field that is Galois over Q and does not contain ζ₅, 100% of Weierstrass equations, ordered by height, define modular curves.

**Key new ingredient (Theorems 1.3 and 4.2.15).** Local–global compatibility at p for the Galois representations that Scholze attached to torsion in the cohomology of GL_n locally symmetric spaces over a CM field. It holds in the crystalline case and in P-ordinary and ordinary variants, for any n and any weight. The prime p may be small and highly ramified; the price is a degree condition at a second p-adic place and decomposed genericity.

Its proof has three parts:
1. **P-ordinary Hida theory (§2.2).** Ordinary parts are taken for the Siegel parabolic of the unitary group G̃ in the Betti cohomology of the Shimura varieties X̃_K̃. This comes with independence of level and weight, and with the P-ordinary part of a parabolic induction computed along the Bruhat filtration (§2.3).
2. **Degree shifting at deep auxiliary level (§4.2).** The level is raised at the other p-adic places, as Scholze suggested. RΓ(U₀, O/ϖ^m) then splits (Lemma 2.3.17), and a descending induction compares spectral sequences over O and over O/ϖ^m. This replaces the hypothesis p > n², p unramified of Allen et al. (ACC+).
3. **A determinant argument (§3.2).** It turns 2n-dimensional P-ordinary crystalline characteristic-zero representations, each with an n-dimensional block congruent to ρ_m, into an integral local lift of ρ_m (Proposition 3.2.4). Theorem 3.1.2 gives the block-triangular shape of Q-ordinary automorphic Galois representations.

A characteristic-zero corollary (Theorem 4.3.1) gives crystallinity at p for regular algebraic cuspidal representations of GL_n over CM and totally real fields.

**Modularity of elliptic curves (§§5–7).**
- **§5.** A potentially Barsotti–Tate automorphy lifting theorem for GL₂ over imaginary CM fields (Theorem 5.2). It uses patching with local rings that have two components; Proposition 5.4.2 carries automorphy between components that meet in the special fibre.
- **§6.** Theorem 6.1 combines Theorem 5.2 with Allen–Khare–Thorne's mod 3 and mod 5 residual modularity, through switching propositions that prescribe the reduction types (6.1.5, 6.1.6).
- **§7.** Imaginary quadratic points are determined on X(ns3°,b5), X(b3,ns5), X(ns3°,ns5) and X(s3,ns5). The methods are rational divisor classes, a genus-2 Jacobian, and Box's relative symmetric-square Chabauty with a Mordell–Weil sieve. The remaining curves are Q-curves, curves with rational j-invariant, or explicit LMFDB curves proved modular by Faltings–Serre.

## What the atlas already has

The ten-author infrastructure is planned:
- PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure PA.0–PA.4: the integral cohomology interface, Fontaine–Laffaille and Borel-ordinary degree shifting, derived support and auxiliary primes;
- ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces ALS.0–ALS.6;
- IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants IHG.0–IHG.5;
- TorsionCohomologyInfrastructure TC.2–TC.3;
- AutomorphicGaloisRepresentationsPartII AG2.2, AG2.5, AG2.7;
- IgusaVarietiesAndTorsionConcentration IG.7 (Caraiani–Scholze concentration);
- local and global deformation rings (R08.x, L7, L8, R04.x) and patching (P8).

These give the 36 planned items. Goursat's lemma is in Mathlib (`Subgroup.goursat_surjective`).

What the atlas lacks:
- local–global compatibility at p beyond the Fontaine–Laffaille and ordinary cases. PAPER-BOXER-CALEGARI-GEE-ETAL-25 imports exactly this result from the present paper, noting that PA.1–PA.2 stop there;
- P-ordinary Hida theory for the Siegel parabolic;
- the new degree-shifting argument;
- automorphy lifting for GL₂ over CM fields with potentially Barsotti–Tate conditions at ramified p;
- modularity of elliptic curves over any field other than Q;
- quadratic points on modular curves with Cartan level.

1. **Part II of PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructure: P-ordinary degree shifting, crystalline local–global compatibility and Barsotti–Tate lifting.** This route covers §§2–5 beyond what ALS, IHG and the local-ring layers own.
   - Its final theorems are Theorems 4.2.15, 4.3.1 and 5.2, stated exactly in the brief.
   - `make_queue.py` folds part-ii routes by parent into DESIGN-PotentialAutomorphyInfrastructurePartII (pending), with the siblings WeightZeroCrystallineAutomorphyLifting, AutomorphyLiftingBeyondTaylorWiles, PolarizedAutomorphyLifting and PotentialAutomorphyDworkMotivesPartII.
   - The brief records that WeightZeroCrystallineAutomorphyLifting imports Theorems 4.2.15 and 4.3.1, Lemma 5.3.3, Proposition 5.4.2 and Corollary 5.4.3 from here, so this route owns them.
2. **Part II of EllipticCurveModularity: elliptic curves over imaginary quadratic and CM fields.** This route covers §§6–7 and Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, as the maintainer's note asks: a Part II of the Serre-modularity direction. It folds with Bennett–Siksek's EllipticModularityEffectiveComparisons into DESIGN-EllipticCurveModularityPartII (pending). It imports Theorem 5.2 from route 1.
3. **Source for EffectiveDiophantineMethods ED.4/ED.5.** Box's relative symmetric-square Chabauty set-up, Proposition 7.4.1 and the sieve criterion of Theorem 7.4.2. The explicit curves stay in route 2.
4. **Source for LocalGaloisDeformationRings L7/L8/R08.4.** The semistable-ordinary lifting ring (Lemma 3.3.2), fixed-determinant power series (Lemma 3.3.6), Snowden's two-component ordinary ring (Proposition 5.3.2) and unique generalisation for the Barsotti–Tate ring (Lemma 5.3.3). Kisin's rings themselves (Theorem 3.3.3) and the Barsotti–Tate components (Lemma 5.3.4) are planned there already.
5. **Source for IntegralHeckeAndGaloisDeterminants IHG.1.** The §3.2 determinant argument: idempotent lifting over a Henselian base (Lemma 3.2.1), the local idempotent (Lemma 3.2.2) and the integral local lift (Proposition 3.2.4), next to the planned generalized matrix algebras and reducibility ideals.
6. **Source for ArithmeticLocallySymmetricSpaces ALS.3/ALS.6.** The topological adelic set-up of §2.1: the limit spaces, the comparison with Newton–Thorne's discrete set-up, and the projection formulas making completed cohomology independent of the weight.

## Source issues

Eleven misprints, each checked on the page image of v3. None affects a result, and all are new (no newer version or erratum exists). The review confirmed all eleven and added E12–E17: E12 is an error in Lemma 5.6.5 that leaves a gap in the proof of Theorem 5.2 for p ≡ 1 mod 3, and E13–E17 are misprints.

## How the items were checked

- Every numbered statement of the paper appears in an item locator. Remarks 1.2.1, 1.3.2 and 5.2.1–5.2.3 are recorded in item notes.
- Planned statuses cite the stage texts of data/atlas.json read on 29 September 2026.
- Library citations were checked in the pinned declaration index (Mathlib 082e2d3, Tau Ceti f790474).
- The Magma computations of §7 (the files cited in the paper) are recorded as the paper's claims. The route 2 brief asks for checkable certificates.

## Corrections by the independent review

REV-PAPER-CARAIANI-NEWTON-23 (Claude Code, session `cc-f805bf`, 29 September 2026) made these changes:

- A `review` verdict on each of E1–E11; all are confirmed on 300-dpi page images of v3 (SHA-256 `57abc79a…d0c3`, the recorded hash). E7's locator is now pp.18–19; E3's review notes that the same statement also writes F for F_v.
- A new error, E12: Lemma 5.6.5 is false when d = 3 and the projective image is A₄. The binary tetrahedral group in SL₂(F̄_p), p ≥ 5, twisted by a cubic character satisfies (5.6.1), but ker det = Q₈ acts irreducibly. The end of the proof of Theorem 5.2 uses the lemma to find the auxiliary places v₀, v₀′, so it has a gap for p ≡ 1 mod 3 with [F₁(ζ_p):F₁] = 3 and projective image A₄. The elliptic-curve theorems use p = 3, 5 and are unaffected. The lemma reads the same in arXiv v1 and v2.
- New misprints E13–E17, each confirmed on the page image: the graded pieces and coefficients in the proof of Lemma 3.3.2; "Prop. 3.2.1" for Lemma 3.2.1; GL_n(Q̄_p) for GL₂(k) on p.83; "places of K" for F on p.86; r̄_{E,p} for r̄_{E,p_i} in the definition of X(H₁,H₂).
- Statements corrected: `chi-character` (the paper divides by the p-adic absolute value), `lem-4-1-5` (G̃^{S̄₁}, away from S̄₁), `prop-5-4-2` (C_a contains x), `patching-axioms` (Assumption 5.4.1 (1)–(2) as printed), `sub-lemma-1-twist` (the index i), and `lem-5-6-5` (the corrected statement, E12). `lem-2-3-8` now includes Corollary 2.3.10. The locators of `lem-2-3-15` (p.41) and `local-rings-5-3` (p.75) are fixed. `thm-5-2` and `proof-thm-5-2` note the gap.
- Statuses changed from planned to missing:
  - `thm-2-1-28`: IG.7 exports ACC+ Theorem 4.3.3 with the length-two and [F⁺:Q] > 1 hypotheses that Koshikawa removes. It goes to a new route 7, a source for IG.7.
  - `relative-symmetric-chabauty`: ED.4 and ED.5 name no symmetric powers. It stays in route 3.
- Planned citations added: L7 for `semistable-ordinary`, ALS.6 for `lem-2-1-6`, TC.3 for `unitary-group-G-tilde` and `unramified-hecke-polys`. `goursat` also cites `Subgroup.goursatFst_prod_goursatSnd_le`.
- Three items added:
  - `blght-lemma-3-3`, planned at DeformationAndDerivedPatchingAlgebra R03.3/R03.6;
  - `solvable-base-change-descent`, planned at GL2AutomorphicRepresentationsAndTransfer R17.4 and ModularityAndLanglandsExtensions ML.5;
  - `akt-tw-primes` (Allen–Khare–Thorne's Taylor–Wiles data without enormous image), missing, in route 1.
- Lemmas 6.1.4, 6.2.2 and 7.1.1 moved from route 2 to a new route 8, a source for ArithmeticGaloisRepresentations R01.4/G7.
- Route 1's brief now names PA.2 as the imported Borel case, PadicFamilies L0a, R03.3/R03.6, R17.4, ML.5 and route 7, and says how to handle E12. Route 2's brief now imports Tau Ceti ModularCurves 5C and 9, GlobalNumberFields layer 1, R01.4, R17.4 and the GL₂-type Part II for Q-curves, and says that ML.1 registers its final theorems.
- The counts are now 169 items (1 library, 36 planned, 132 missing), 8 routes and 17 `sourceIssues`. `sourceVersions` also lists arXiv v1 and v2, which were compared at several findings.
